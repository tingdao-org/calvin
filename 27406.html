<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>And when the Sabbath came. </em>The great assembly of the people doth prove that Paul and Barnabas loitered not between the Sabbaths, and they did not take pains with the Gentiles in vain; for the studies and desires of the people had been so prepared, that they all desired to know the whole matter more surely, which they did hope would be, if it should be discussed among the Jews. For we may guess that though they were allured with some sweet taste, yet were they not as yet thoroughly persuaded to receive the doctrine of the gospel without doubting, <span class="cite-ref">(829)</span> but that they came into the synagogue in a quandary, <span class="cite-ref">(830)</span> between hope and desire. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(829)</span> “Sine controversia,” without controversy. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(830)</span> “Suspensi,” suspended. </p></div></div>
