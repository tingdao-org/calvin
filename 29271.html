<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Now to him. </em>He now breaks out into thanksgiving, which serves the additional purpose of exhorting the Ephesians to maintain “good hope through grace,” (<span class="bvs">2Th_2:16</span>,) and to endeavor constantly to obtain more and more adequate conceptions of the value of the grace of God. </p><p><em>Who is able. </em><span class="cite-ref">(137)</span> This refers to the future, and agrees with what we are taught concerning hope; and indeed we cannot offer to God proper or sincere thanksgivings for favors received, unless we are convinced that his goodness to us will be without end. When he says that God is <em>able, </em>he does not mean power viewed apart, as the phrase is, from the act, but power which is exerted, and which we actually feel. Believers ought always to connect it with the work, when the promises made to them, and their own salvation, form the subject of inquiry. Whatever God can do, he unquestionably will do, if he has promised it. This the apostle proves both by former instances, and by the efficacy of the Spirit, which was at this very time exerted on their own minds. </p><p><em>According to the power that worketh in us, </em>— according to what we feel within ourselves; for every benefit which God bestows upon us is a manifestation of his grace, and love, and power, in consequence of which we ought to cherish a stronger confidence for the future<em>. Exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, </em>is a remarkable expression, and bids us entertain no fear lest faith of a proper kind should go to excess. Whatever expectations we form of Divine blessings, the infinite goodness of God will exceed all our wishes and all our thoughts. </p><p><strong>(137)</strong> “Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. He that hungereth, let him hunger more; and he that desireth, let him still more abundantly desire; for all that he can desire he shall fully obtain.” — Bernard. </p></div>
