<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为他没有什么偿还之物，主人吩咐把他和他妻子儿女，并一切所有的都卖了偿还。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>His master ordered him to be sold. </em>It would be an idle exercise of ingenuity to examine here every minute clause. For God does not always display severity at first, till, constrained to pray, we implore pardon, but rather meets us with undeserved goodness. But Christ only shows what will become of us, if God shall treat us with the utmost severity; and again, if He shall choose to demand from us what we owe, how necessary it is for us to betake ourselves to prayer, because this is the only refuge that remains for transgressors. We must also attend to the wide difference of the sums; for, since one <em>talent </em>is worth more than <em>a hundred pence</em>, what proportion will <em>a hundred pence </em>bear to <em>ten thousand talents? </em></p></div>
