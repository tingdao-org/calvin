<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">彼拉多说，你们自己带他去，按着你们的律法审问他吧。犹太人说，我们没有杀人的权柄。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>According to your law. </em>Pilate, offended by their barbarous and violent proceedings, undoubtedly reproaches them by stating that this form of condemnation, which they were eager to carry into effcct, was at variance with the common law of all nations and with the feelings of mankind; and, at the same time he censures them for boasting that they had a <em>law </em>given to them by God. </p><p><em>Take you him. </em>He says this ironically; for he would not have allowed them to pronounce on a man a sentence of capital punishment; but it is as if he had said, “Were he in your power, he would instantly be executed, without being heard in his own defense; and, is this the equity of your Law, to condemn a man without any crime?” Thus do wicked men, falsely assuming the name of God as an excuse for their conduct, expose his holy doctrine to the reproaches of enemies, and the world eagerly seizes on it as an occasion of slander. </p><p><em>We are not allowed. </em>Those who think that the Jews refuse an offer, which Pilate had made to them, are mistaken; but rather, knowing that he had said to them in mockery, <em>Take you him, </em>they reply, “You would not allow it; and since you are the judge, execute your office.” </p></div>
