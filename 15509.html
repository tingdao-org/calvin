<div class="comment-content"><p>In the close of the psalm he repeats the same sentence which we had in the fifth verse, only substituting <em>his holy mountain </em>instead of <em>his footstool; </em>and as for the sake of brevity he had formerly said somewhat obscurely <span class="lang he-il">קדוש הוא</span>, <em>kadosh hu, he is holy, </em>he now says more plainly, <em>Jehovah our God is holy </em>His intention is to show that God is not to be worshipped by the Israelites at random, (as the religion of the heathen depended upon fancy alone,) but that his worship is founded upon the assurance of faith. </p></div>
