<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华在沧海中开道，在大水中开路。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Thus saith Jehovah. </em>He again repeats and confirms what was otherwise incredible; and, in order that this confirmation may have greater weight, he personates God himself. </p><p><em>Who maketh a way in the sea. </em>He reminds them of former benefits, that, having experienced his power and kindness, they may believe that he will not be less gracious for the future, nor less powerful to deliver them. As if he had said, “The Lord who speaks will actually shew how vast is the greatness of his power. Your fathers experienced it, and you will not experience it the less.” Now, we are ungrateful to God, if former benefits do not lead us to entertain hope for the future; and especially when he intended to give a sure and striking proof of continual favor towards us. He brought the Jews out of Egypt on the express condition, that the deliverance which was accomplished should never be forgotten. (<span class="bvs">Exo_13:9</span>.) </p><p>The Prophet therefore represents God as actually present, and declares that he is the same God who surmounted every obstacle by his power, that he might be the Redeemer of his people. At that time he opened up a way through the sea, (<span class="bvs">Exo_14:21</span>,) and afterwards <em>through the mighty waters, </em>that is, through Jordan, which the Lord dried up, though it was running very rapidly. (<span class="bvs">Jos_3:16</span>.) And these prodigious miracles he expressly relates, because they might think that their return to Judea was closed up, and that all that was promised concerning it was fabulous. </p></div>
