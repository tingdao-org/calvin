<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">But God raised him from the dead:</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神却叫他从死里复活。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>God hath raised him up. </em>The death of Christ was the salvation of the godly, yet joined with the resurrection; therefore doth Paul stand longer upon this second point. For he should never have persuaded his hearers that they were to seek salvation in Christ’s death, unless the power of Almighty God had appeared in raising Christ from death. </p></div>
