<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">吹号的，歌唱的都一齐发声，声合为一，赞美感谢耶和华。吹号，敲钹，用各种乐器，扬声赞美耶和华说，耶和华本为善，他的慈爱永远长存。那时，耶和华的殿有云充满，</div></div>
