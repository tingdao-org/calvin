<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">基利波山哪，愿你那里没有雨露。愿你田地无土产可作供物。因为英雄的盾牌在那里被污丢弃。扫罗的盾牌仿佛未曾抹油。</div></div>
