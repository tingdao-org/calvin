<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>This is the sum of the tabernacle </em><span class="cite-ref">(302)</span> As much as to say that this was the computation, or these the numbers; for he gives us to understand that not only was the tabernacle thus at once completed, but that its several parts were numerically distinguished, and consigned as it were to registers, <span class="cite-ref">(303)</span> so as to be given in charge to the Levites, lest any part of it should be lost. For the reference here is not so much to the fabric, or the architecture of the tabernacle, as to its perpetual conservation, viz., that Ithamar the priest deposited its several parts with the Levites, and this in accordance with the command of Moses. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(302)</span> “These are the counted<em>- </em>things.” — <em>Lat</em>.
