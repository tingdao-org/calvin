<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王的本分是在节期，月朔，安息日，就是以色列家一切的节期，奉上燔祭，素祭，奠祭。他要预备赎罪祭，素祭，燔祭，和平安祭，为以色列家赎罪。</div></div>
