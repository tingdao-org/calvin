<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">愿那喜欢我遭难的，一同抱愧蒙羞。愿那向我妄自尊大的，披惭愧，蒙羞辱。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Let those who rejoice at thy hurt be ashamed and confounded together. </em>This imprecation has already been expounded; and it is only necessary to remark, that there is peculiar force in the expression, <em>together, </em>or <em>at once. </em>It shows that it was not only one or two, but a great multitude, who waged war against him, and that he yielded not to the influence of fear, but believed that as soon as God should lift up his hand, he could at one stroke easily overthrow them all. When it is said that they seek after and <em>rejoice in David’s hurt, </em>this shows that they were filled with cruel hatred against him. And when it is said, that they <em>magnify themselves against him, </em>this is a token of pride. David, therefore, in order to render them more hateful in the sight of God, represents them as filled with pride and cruelty. And as this form of prayer was dictated by the Holy Spirit to David, there can be no doubt that the end of all the proud shall be such as is here predicted, that they shall turn back overwhelmed with shame and disgrace. </p></div>
