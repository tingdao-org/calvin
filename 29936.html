<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你要赶紧给律师西纳，和亚波罗送行，叫他们没有缺乏。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>Zenas a lawyer </em>It is uncertain whether “Zenas”, was a Doctor of the Civil Law or of the Law of Moses; but as we may learn from Paul’s words that he was a poor man and needed the help of others, it is probable that he belonged to the same rank with <em>Apollo, </em>that is, an expounder of the Law of God among the Jews. It more frequently happens that such persons are in want of the necessaries of life than those who conduct causes in civil courts. I have said that Zenas’s poverty may be inferred from the words of Paul, because the expression, <em>conduct him, </em>means here to supply him with the means of accomplishing his journey, as is evident from what follows. </p></div>
