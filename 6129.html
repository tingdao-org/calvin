<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And at that time came Joshua, </em>etc Of the sons of Anak we have spoken elsewhere. They were a race of giants, with the account of whose mighty stature the spies so terrified the people, that they refused to proceed into the land of Canaan. Therefore, seeing they were objects of so much dread, it was of importance that they should be put out of the way, and the people made more alert by their good hopes of success. It would have been exceedingly injurious <span class="cite-ref">(119)</span> to keep objects which filled them with alarm and anxiety always present before their minds, inasmuch as fear obscured the glory ascribed to God for former victories, and overthrew their faith, while they reflected that the most difficult of all their contests still awaited them. Therefore, not without cause is it mentioned among the other instances of divine aid, that by purging the land of such monsters, it was rendered a fit habitation for the people. The less credible it seemed that they could be warred against with success, the more illustriously was the divine power displayed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(119)</span> Latin, “Perquam noxium.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Fort dangereuse</span>;” “Very dangerous.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
