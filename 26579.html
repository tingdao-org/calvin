<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们就寻找耶稣，站在殿里彼此说，你们的意思如何，他不来过节吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>56.</strong><em>They therefore sought Jesus. </em>The design of the Evangelist is, to show how extensively the fame of Christ was diffused through the whole of Judea; for they who assemble in the temple, from whatever quarter they come, are eager to seek Christ, and are employed in holding conversations among themselves concerning him. It is true that they <em>seek </em>him after a human fashion, but yet, in <em>seeking </em>him, they discover that it is the tyranny of the priests which prevents him from appearing openly. </p></div>
