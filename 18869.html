<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你的装扮为何有红色，你的衣服为何像踹酒榨的呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Wherefore is thy raiment red? </em>He proceeds with the same subject; but, as it would have impaired the force of the narrative, he does not immediately explain whence came the red color of God’s garments, but continues to put questions, that he may arouse their minds to the consideration of what is strange and uncommon. He means that this sprinkling of blood is something remarkable and extraordinary. The comparison drawn from a “wine-press” is highly appropriate; for the town Bozrah, which he mentioned a little before, lay in a vine-bearing district. As if he had said, “There will be other vintages than those which are customary; for blood shall be shed instead of the juice of the grapes.” </p></div>
