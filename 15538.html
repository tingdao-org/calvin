<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为耶和华建造了锡安，在他荣耀里显现。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The concluding part of the 16<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, <em>He hath appeared in his glory, </em>refers to the manifestation which God made of himself when he brought forth his Church from the darkness of death; even as it is said in another place concerning her first deliverance, “Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominions” (<span class="bvs">Psa_114:2</span>) In like manner in the present passage, by again gathering to himself his people who were dispersed, and by raising his Church, as it were, from death to life, he appeared in his glory. It is surely no ordinary consolation to know that the love of God towards us is so great, that he will have his glory to shine forth in our salvation. It is true, that when the pious Jews were in the midst of their afflictions, the working of divine power was hidden from them; but they nevertheless always beheld it by the eye of faith, and in the mirror of the divine promises. </p></div>
