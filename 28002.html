<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong>The first effect is, that <em>there is none that understands: </em>and then this ignorance is immediately proved, for <em>they seek not God; </em>for empty is the man in whom there is not the knowledge of God, whatever other learning he may possess; yea, the sciences and the arts, which in themselves are good, are empty things, when they are without this groundwork. </p></div>
