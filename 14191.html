<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们都屈身仆倒，我们却起来，立得正直。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>They are bowed down. </em>It is probable that there is here pointed out, as it were with the finger, the enemies of Israel, whom God had overthrown, when they regarded no event as less likely to happen. There is contained in the words a tacit contrast between the cruel pride with which they had been lifted up for a time when they audaciously rushed forward to make havoc of all things on the one hand, and the oppression of the people of God on the other. The expression, <em>to rise, </em>is applied only to those who were before sunk or fallen; and, on the other hand, the expression, <em>bowed down and fallen, </em>is with propriety applied to those who were lifted up with pride and presumption. The prophet therefore teaches by the event, how much more advantageous it is for us to place all our confidence in God than to depend upon our own strength. </p></div>
