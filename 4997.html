<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And I commanded Joshua at that time. </em>He repeats what we have already seen, that he exhorted Joshua together with the whole people to prepare themselves to occupy the land with alacrity, relying as well upon God’s promise, as upon the numerous proofs of His assistance, which were so many pledges of the future continuance of His grace. </p></div>
