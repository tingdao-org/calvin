<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">君王不能因兵多得胜。勇士不能因力大得救。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>It therefore follows, <em>A king is not saved for the multitude of his host, etc </em>By this the inspired writer means to teach us, that the safety of men’s lives depends not upon their own strength, but upon the favor of God. He names particularly <em>kings </em>and <em>giants </em>rather than others; because, as they are not of the common class of men, but of a higher condition, they appear to themselves to be beyond the reach of all danger from darts, and if any adversity befall them, they promise themselves an easy deliverance from it. In short, intoxicated with a presumptuous confidence of their own strength, they scarcely think themselves mortal. They are still more hardened in this pride by the foolish admiration of the common people, who stand amazed at the greatness of their power. If, therefore, neither a king is saved by his troops, nor a giant by his strength, when they are exposed to danger, in vain do mankind neglect the providence of God, and look around them for human help. From this it follows, that the condition, both of the strong and the weak, is miserable, until they learn to rely on the protection of God. </p></div>
