<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王就差遣人将示每召了来，对他说，我岂不是叫你指着耶和华起誓，并且警戒你说你当确实地知道，你哪日出来往别处去，那日必死吗？你也对我说，这话甚好，我必听从。</div></div>
