<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在摩押的各房顶上和街市上处处有人哀哭。因我打碎摩押，好像打碎无人喜悦的器皿。这是耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet at the beginning of the verse continues the same subject, that the Moabites would weep and lament throughout <em>all their houses </em>and in <em>all their streets </em>The reason is added in the second clause, because God would bring a severe judgment on that nation. </p><p>By saying that there would be <em>lamentation on all the roofs</em>, he refers to what was customary at that time, for they had their walks on the roofs or tops of their houses. Then he says, that the Moabites, in order to be more seen and to excite pity, would ascend on the roofs, and cry, howl, and lament there. But we must observe what is added, that the calamity would come from God; for it would not have been sufficient to foretell adversity, except this was added, that God ascended his tribunal to execute his judgments when he thus chastised the people. He also compares the people of Moab to a <em>despised vessel, </em>in order to make a distinction between God’s children and aliens; for God does also chastise his own people when they sin, but he ceases not to love them and to regard them as precious. Now he says that Moab would be a vessel despised and rejected. <span class="cite-ref">(21)</span> It now follows, — </p><p><strong>(21)</strong> All the versions and <em>Targ. </em>read, “as a useless vessel;” but the Hebrew is, “as a vessel without delight in it,” <em>i.e., </em>as a vessel which has nothing pleasing or agreeable in it. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
