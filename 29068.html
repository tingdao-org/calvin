<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Now I make known to you. </em>This is the most powerful argument, the main hinge on which the question turns, that he has not received the gospel from men, but that it has been revealed to him by God. As this might be denied, he offers a proof, drawn from a narrative of facts. To give his declaration the greater weight, he sets out with stating that the matter is not doubtful, <span class="cite-ref">(26)</span> but one which he is prepared to prove; and thus introduces himself in a manner well adapted to a serious subject. He affirms that it is <em>not according to man</em>; that it savours of nothing human, or, that it was not of human contrivance; and in proof of this he afterwards adds, that he had not been instructed by any earthly teacher. <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(26)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il ne parle point d’une chose incertaine ou incognue</span>.” “That he does not speak about a thing uncertain or unknown.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(27)</span> “The idiom by which there is a transposition of <span class="lang el-gr">ὅτι</span> is frequent, and may here, Schott thinks, have been made use of, in order to place a highly important topic in the most prominent point of view” — Bloomfield. </p></div></div>
