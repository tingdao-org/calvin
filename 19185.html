<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华说，我岂不因这些事讨他们的罪呢？岂不报复这样的国民呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>We have already met with this verse; it will therefore be enough briefly to refer to what it contains. God shews here, that except he denied himself he must necessarily punish the Jews. How so? He takes it as granted that he is the judge of the world: he had said that the Jews were not only become wicked in one thing, but were so given up to all kinds of wickedness, that they wearied themselves; what then was to be done? God would not have acted in a manner worthy of himself, nor preserved consistency, had he not punished such men; for he must have changed his nature, had he not hated such a perverse nation. But he speaks after the manner of men when he mentions vengeance; for we know that no passions belong to God, as it has been often stated: but as he hates wickedness, so he is said to execute vengeance, when he appears as a judge and chastises those by whom he has been provoked to wrath. </p></div>
