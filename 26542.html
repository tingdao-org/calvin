<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">有好些犹太人来看马大和马利亚，要为她们的兄弟安慰她们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>To comfort them concerning their brother. </em>This was, no doubt, the object which they had in view, but God had another object to accomplish, as we have stated. It is evident from what is here mentioned, that the house of Lazarus and his sisters was greatly respected and honored. Again, as it is natural that the death of friends should occasion grief and mourning to men, this duty, which the Evangelist mentions, ought not to be blamed, unless on this ground, that sinful excess, which prevails in this and in other departments of life, corrupts what is not in itself sinful. </p></div>
