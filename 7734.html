<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大卫又起誓说，你父亲准知我在你眼前蒙恩。他心里说，不如不叫约拿单知道，恐怕他愁烦。我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我离死不过一步。</div></div>
