<div class="CUV verse">她们若要学什么，可以在家里问自己的丈夫。因为妇女在会中说话原是可耻的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>If they wish to learn any thing. </em>That he may not seem, by this means, to shut out women from opportunities of learning, he desires them, if they are in doubt as to anything, to inquire in private, that they may not stir up any disputation in public. When he says, <em>husbands, </em>he does not prohibit them from consulting the Prophets themselves, if necessary. For all husbands are not competent to give an answer in such a case; but, as he is reasoning here as to external polity, he reckons it sufficient to point out what is unseemly, that the Corinthians may guard against it. In the meantime, it is the part of the prudent reader to consider, that the things of which he here treats are intermediate and indifferent, in which there is nothing unlawful, but what is at variance with propriety and edification. </p></div>
