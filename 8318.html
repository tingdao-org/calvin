<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">将城里的人拉出来，放在锯下，或铁耙下，或铁斧下，或叫他经过砖窑（或作强他们用锯，或用打粮食的铁器，或用铁斧作工，或使在砖窑里服役）。大卫待亚扪各城的居民都是如此。其后，大卫和众军都回耶路撒冷去了。</div></div>
