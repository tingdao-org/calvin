<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong><em>And Moses said, Wherefore do ye now transgress? </em>He rejects this feigned penitence, whereby the sinner tries all sorts of shifts, <span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> so as not to submit himself to God. “If thou wilt return, O Israel, return unto me,” saith the Lord by Jeremiah, (<span class="bvs">Jer_4:1</span>.) The first thing, therefore, which we must consider is, what God requires of us; so that it may plainly appear that we truly submit ourselves to His power. </p><p>In order to restrain their temerity, Moses reminds them that they will seek in vain for success, when they depart from God’s command. And this is a very useful piece of instruction, that His grace will never be wanting to us, if we simply obey His word; but when, in contempt and neglect of His precepts, we are carried away by our own feelings, the event will never be prosperous. If any should object that the wretched people had no other remedy, I have already stated, that they ought to have been contented with this consolation, viz., that banishment from the land of Canaan was not disinheritance from the hope of eternal life. Nay, if they had humbled themselves before God, they might expect that their punishment would have been a profitable help to them. By their misdirected activity they double the evil. After having pointed out their danger, Moses again impresses upon them that God is not with them, because they had deserted Him: and that His blessing was withheld, because they had refused to follow Him at the proper time. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(78)</span> “En laquelle les pecheurs tournent a l’entour du pot;” whereby sinners twist round the pot. —<em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
