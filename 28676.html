<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>When I was a child </em>He illustrates what he had said, by a similitude. For there are many things that are suitable to children, which are afterwards done away on arriving at maturity. For example, education is necessary for childhood; it does not comport with mature age. <span class="cite-ref">(799)</span> So long as we live in this world, we require, in some sense, education. We are far from having attained, as yet, the perfection of wisdom. That perfection, therefore, which will be in a manner a maturity of spiritual age, will put an end to education and its accompaniments. In his Epistle to the Ephesians, (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:14</span>,) he exhorts us to be no <em>longer children; </em>but he has there another consideration in view, of which we shall speak when we come to that passage. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(799)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Elle ne conuient point a ceux qui sont en aage de discretion</span>;” — “It does not become those who are at the age of discretion?’ </p></div></div>
