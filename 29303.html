<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">一切苦毒，恼恨，忿怒，嚷闹，毁谤，并一切的恶毒，（或作阴毒）都当从你们中间除掉。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Let all bitterness. </em>He again condemns anger; but, on the present occasion, views in connection with it those offenses by which it is usually accompanied, such as noisy disputes and reproaches. Between <em>wrath and anger </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">Θυμὸν καὶ ὀργὴν</span>) there is little difference, except that the former denotes the power, and the latter the act; but here, the only difference is, that <em>anger </em>is a more sudden attack. The correction of all the rest will be greatly aided by the removal of <em>malice. </em>By this term he expresses that depravity of mind which is opposed to humanity and justice, and which is usually called <em>malignity. </em></p></div>
