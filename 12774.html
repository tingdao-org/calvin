<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王的一切臣仆和各省的人民，都知道有一个定例，若不蒙召，擅入内院见王的，无论男女必被治死。除非王向他伸出金杖，不得存活。现在我没有蒙召进去见王已经三十日了。</div></div>
