<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华对摩西说，你的死期临近了。要召约书亚来，你们二人站在会幕里，我好嘱咐他。于是摩西和约书亚去站在会幕里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And the Lord said unto Moses. </em>Joshua is now substituted in the place of Moses by a solemn ceremony, not only that he may be held in greater reverence by men, but also that he may be presented before God, and thus may acknowledge that he is dedicated to His service; for his being brought before the door of the tabernacle was a kind of consecration; and God also declares that He will give him a charge, which is equivalent to saying that He will instruct him in the performance of his duties. The appearance also of the glory of God in the cloud, was not less effectual for encouraging himself personally, than for giving public distinction to his high office. For he would never have been recognized as the successor of Moses, unless this visible approbation of God had fastened the yoke upon the people. </p></div>
