<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为预言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动说出神的话来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. </em>They did not of themselves, or according to their own will, foolishly deliver their own inventions. The meaning is, that the beginning of right knowledge is to give that credit to the holy prophets which is due to God. He calls them the <em>holy men of God, </em>because they faithfully executed the office committed to them, having sustained the person of God in their ministrations. He says that they were — not that they were bereaved of mind, (as the Gentiles imagined their prophets to have been,) but because they dared not to announce anything of their own, and obediently followed the Spirit as their guide, who ruled in their mouth as in his own sanctuary. Understand by <em>prophecy of Scripture </em>that which is contained in the holy Scriptures. </p></div>
