<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因你所要赶出的那些国民都听信观兆的和占卜的，至于你，耶和华你的神从来不许你这样行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>For these nations. </em>As God had just before been setting before them the punishment He was about to inflict upon these nations, in order to alarm and warn them, so now does he admonish them that the inheritance was handed over to them on this condition, that they should be mindful of so great a benefit, and beware of all pollutions; and that they succeeded the former inhabitants of the land, with a view to their being separate from them; for whence was this change, except that God might acquire to Himself a new people, and purify the land from all its defilements? Although He only mentions two classes of superstitions, yet thus, by <em>synecdoche, </em>He indicates them all. The sum is, that they should not be like the nations in vices and corruptions, which had been the cause of their destruction; since God had not only exterminated the men themselves, but their abominable rites also. Some divide the latter part of the verse into two clauses, “but thou shalt not do so;” and then, “Jehovah gives you the land,” which last word they supply. But I do not hesitate to think that the pronoun <span class="lang he-il">אתה</span><em>, athah, </em>must be thus rendered, “But as for thee;” and then I think it must be read continuously, “God hath not suffered thee to do so,” for the word <span class="lang he-il">נתן</span>, <em>nathan, </em>is of extensive signification. The tendency of the whole is, that the prohibition of God should be of more weight with them than the example of the nations. </p></div>
