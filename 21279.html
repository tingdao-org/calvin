<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在那里有北方的众王子和一切西顿人，都与被杀的人下去。他们虽然仗着势力使人惊恐，还是蒙羞。他们未受割礼，和被刀杀的一同躺卧，与下坑的人一同担当羞辱。</div></div>
