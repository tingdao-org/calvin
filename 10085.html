<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你借你的使者辱骂主，并说，我率领许多战车上山顶，到利巴嫩极深之处。我要砍伐其中高大的香柏树和佳美的松树。我必上极高之处，进入肥田的树林。</div></div>
