<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>To tempt the Spirit. </em>He uttereth the same thing in other words which he had said before; to wit, that they did mock God unreverently and contemptibly. But he said that they <em>tempted </em>the Spirit, because they had cunningly packed their fraud, as if the Spirit of God were not the knower of the hearts. For it was a point of too great carelessness, seeing the one made the other privy to their wickedness, to make their match between themselves, having, as it were, excluded God. For the Scripture saith, that God is tempted either when his power is taken from him, or the knowledge of all things is denied him. Furthermore, he meaneth that Spirit which governed the Church by the apostles. For when Christ saith, When the Spirit cometh, he shall judge the world, he noteth no other kind of authority than that which he exerciseth by the ministry of the Church. </p></div>
