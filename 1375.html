<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house</em>. What Moses now relates, was prior in the order of events. For before Joseph sent for his father, the report of the coming of his brethren had reached the palace. And Joseph would not have promised so confidently a home to his brethren in Egypt, except by the king’s permission. What, therefore, Moses had before briefly alluded to, he now more fully explains; namely, that the king, with a ready and cheerful mind, declared his high esteem for Joseph, in freely offering to his father and brethren, the most fertile part of Egypt for their dwelling. And from another statement of Moses it appears that, as long as he lived, the Israelites were treated with clemency and kindness. For, in <span class="bvs">Exo_1:8</span>, the commencement of the tyranny and cruelty is said to have been made by his successor, to whom Joseph was unknown. </p></div>
