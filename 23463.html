<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Art thou he who was to come? </em>John takes for granted what the disciples had known from their childhood; for it was the first lesson of religion, and common among all the Jews, that Christ <em>was to come, </em>bringing salvation and perfect happiness. On this point, accordingly, he does not raise a doubt, but only inquires if Jesus be that promised Redeemer; for, having been persuaded of the redemption promised in the Law and the Prophets, they were bound to receive it when exhibited in the person of Christ. He adds, <em>Do we look for another? </em>By this expression, he indirectly glances at their sloth, which allowed them, after having been distinctly informed, to remain so long in doubt and hesitation. At the same time, he shows what is the nature and power of faith. Resting on the truth of God, it does not gaze on all sides, does not vary, but is satisfied with Christ alone, and will not be turned to another. </p></div>
