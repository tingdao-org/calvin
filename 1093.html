<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">后来他又作了一梦，也告诉他的哥哥们说，看哪，我又作了一梦，梦见太阳，月亮，与十一个星向我下拜。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And he dreamed yet another dream</em>. The scope of this dream is the same. The only difference is, that God, to inspire greater confidence in the oracle, presents him with a figure from heaven. The brethren of Joseph had despised what was said concerning the sheaves; the Lord now calls upon them to look towards heaven, where his august Majesty shines forth. It may, however, be asked, how it can be reconciled with fact, that his mother, who was now dead, could come and bow down to him. The interpretation of certain Hebrews, who refer it to Bilhah, is frigid, and the sense appears plain without such subterfuges: for the sun and moon designate the head of the family on each side: thus, in this figure, Joseph sees himself reverenced by the whole house of his father. </p></div>
