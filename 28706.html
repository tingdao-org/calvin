<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Let him speak to himself and to God </em>“Let him enjoy,” says he, “his gift in his own conscience, and let him give thanks to God.” For in this way I explain the expression to <em>speak to himself and to God, </em>as meaning — to recognize in his own mind with thanksgiving the favor conferred upon him, <span class="cite-ref">(860)</span> and to enjoy it as his own, when there is not an opportunity for bringing it forward in a public manner. For he draws a contrast between this <em>secret </em>way of speaking, and speaking <em>publicly </em>in the Church — which he forbids. <span class="cite-ref">(861)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(860)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le benefice et don de Dieu</span>;” — “The kindness and gift of God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(861)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En ce cas</span>;” — “In this case.” </p></div></div>
