<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">论到提多，他是我的同伴，一同为你们劳碌的。论到那两位兄弟，他们是众教会的使者，是基督的荣耀。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>In calling them the <em>Apostles of the Churches, </em>he might be understood in <em>two </em>senses — either as meaning that they had been set apart by God as <em>Apostles to the Churches, </em>or that they had been appointed by the Churches to undertake that office. The <em>second </em>of these is the more suitable. They are called also the <em>glory of Christ, </em>for this reason, that as he alone is the glory of believers, so he ought also to be glorified by them in return. Hence, all that excel in piety and holiness are the <em>glory of Christ, </em>because they have nothing but by Christ’s gift. </p></div>
