<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And I have given to them the glory which thou gavest to me. </em>Let it be observed here, that, while a pattern of perfect happiness was exhibited in Christ, he had nothing that belonged peculiarly to himself, but rather was rich, in order to enrich those who believed in him. Our happiness lies in having the image of God restored and formed anew in us, which was defaced by sin. Christ is not only the lively image of God, in so far as he is the eternal Word of God. but even on his human nature, which he has in common with us, the likeness of <em>the glory </em>of the Father has been engraved, so as to form his members to the resemblance of it. Paul also teaches us this, that </p><p>we all, with unveiled face, by beholding THE GLORY OF GOD, are changed into the same image, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_3:18</span>.) </p><p>Hence it follows, that no one ought to be reckoned among the disciples of Christ, unless we perceive <em>the glory of God </em>impressed on him, as with a seal, by the likeness of Christ. To the same purpose are the words which immediately follow: </p></div>
