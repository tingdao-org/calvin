<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们要对他们如此说，不是那创造天地的神，必从地上从天下被除灭。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now, the reason why he bids the Israelites to speak in the Chaldee language is, because they had been led into exile, and were mingled with the Assyrians and Chaldeans. He then required from those despised exiles an open and a bold confession, as though he had said, “Even though ye are now in the most miserable bondage, and though the Chaldeans disdainfully oppress you, as if ye were slaves, yet proclaim the glory of God and shrink not from an open confession of your religion, and say to them, in contempt of all their idols, <em>perish must your gods from the earth and from under heaven, for they have not made heaven nor the earth.” </em>We now understand the meaning of the Prophet. But the rest I shall defer until tomorrow. </p></div>
