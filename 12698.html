<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我又说，以色列王所罗门不是在这样的事上犯罪吗？在多国中并没有一王像他，且蒙他神所爱，神立他作以色列全国的王。然而连他也被外邦女子引诱犯罪。</div></div>
