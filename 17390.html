<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">有人孤单无二，无子，无兄，竟劳碌不息，眼目也不以钱财为足。他说，我劳劳碌碌，刻苦自己，不享福乐，到底是为谁呢？这也是虚空，是极重的劳苦。</div></div>
