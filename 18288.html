<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大路荒凉，行人止息。敌人背约，藐视城邑，不顾人民。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>The roads are deserted. </em>He now adds, that “the roads” will be shut up, so that no one shall go in or out; which commonly happens when war has been declared. The Prophet appears to represent the ambassadors as declaring that henceforth there will be no opportunity of carrying on merchandise, and even that the highways will not be safe. <span class="cite-ref">(9)</span> It is immediately added, — </p><p><em>They have violated the treaty. </em>These words are viewed by some commentators as a complaint made by hypocrites that God does not fulfill his promises. If it were thought proper to view them as referring to God, still it would not be necessary to say that such a complaint proceeds from none but wicked men; for sometimes believers also quarrel with God in this manner. But I cannot approve of that interpretation; and, therefore, consider this to be a part of the description which the Prophet gives of the cruelty and insatiable rage of Sennacherib, in treacherously breaking the treaty which he had formerly made with Hezekiah; for, although he had promised that he would maintain peace, yet as soon as an opportunity presented itself for invading Judea, he violated his promise and made preparations for war. Such is also the import of the conclusion of the verse, that <em>he hath despised the cities, he hath regarded no man, </em>which means that his cruelty will be so great that he will not be restrained by shame or fear. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(9)</span> “These are not the words of the ambassadors reporting the condition of the country (Grotius), but of the Prophet himself describing it. The scene presented is not that of Protestant cities seized by Antichrist, and a stop put to a religious course and conversation (Gill), but the actual condition of Judea during the Assyrian invasion. (Compare <span class="bvs">Jud_5:6</span>).” —<em>Alexander. </em></p></div></div>
