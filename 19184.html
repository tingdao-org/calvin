<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们的舌头是毒箭，说话诡诈。人与邻舍口说和平话，心却谋害他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet again complains of the deceitfulness of their tongues; and he compares them to deadly, or drawn out arrows. Gold is said to be drawn out, when refined by repeated meltings; so also arrows, when sharpened, are more piercing. The Prophet then says, that their tongues were like deadly or sharpened arrows: how so? because they ever spoke guile, by either slandering or circumventing others. But the expression is general; and the Prophet no doubt meant to include all modes of deceiving. </p><p>For it afterwards follows, <em>With the mouth they speak peace; </em>that is, every one professed friendship, and his words were honey; and yet <em>within he did set up, </em>or concealed <em>intrigues. </em>Here in other words he sets forth their perfidy; for the tongue and the heart differed. They shewed by the tongue what was different from the sentiment of the heart. Hence he says, that they <em>set up treacheries in the midst of them, </em>or in their hearts, while they <em>spoke peace </em>with the mouth, that is, pretended brotherly kindness. <span class="cite-ref">(241)</span> At last he repeats again what he had said before, (<span class="bvs">Jer_5:9</span>) — </p><p><strong>(241)</strong> The word, <span class="lang he-il">שוחט</span>, means “killing” or slaying; see <span class="bvs">Gen_22:10</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_37:31</span>; <span class="bvs">Exo_12:6</span>. Its primary meaning, as Parkhurst thinks, is to shed, or to <em>drain off</em>, either blood from animals, or juice from grapes, or gold from dross. But it is used in the sense of slaying. The <em>Septuagint </em>and the <em>Vulgate </em>render it here, “wounding,” — </p><p>A killing arrow <em>is </em>their tongue; Deceit it speaks; With his mouth does <em>one </em>speak peace to his neighbor, But in his heart he sets an ambush for him. </p><p>Literally, “his ambush,” that is, the ambush of which he is the object. This form of speech is often in Hebrew. See <span class="bvs">Job_28:10</span>. “Penit ei insidias “ is the <em>Vulgate. Blayney </em>gives a paraphrase, not a version, — </p><p>But inwardly will he resolve to fall upon him by surprise. </p><p>The future tense here, as in many other instances, is used as a present tense, and designed to shew the habitual practice of the people. The same is done in the Welsh language: the future tense is continually used to express a present action. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
