<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以及我在安提阿，以哥念，路司得，所遭遇的逼迫，苦难。我所忍受是何等的逼迫。但从这一切苦难中主都把我救出来了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>But out of them all the Lord delivered me </em>It is a consolation which mitigates the bitterness of afflictions, that they always have a happy and joyful end. If it be objected, that the success of which he boasts is not always visible, I acknowledge that this is true, so far as relates to the feeling of the flesh; for Paul had not yet been delivered. But when God sometimes delivers us, he testifies, in this manner, that he is present with us, and will always be present; for from the feeling, or actual knowledge, of present aid, our confidence ought to be extended to the future. The meaning, therefore, is as if he had said, “Thou hast known by experience that God hath never forsaken me, so that thou hast no right to hesitate to follow my example.” </p></div>
