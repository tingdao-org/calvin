<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣看见，便叫过她来，对她说，女人，你脱离这病了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Woman, thou art delivered </em>In this miracle, as well as in others, Christ exhibited a proof both of his power and of his grace; for in this manner he testified that he had come for the purpose of granting relief to the wretched. His power is expressed in these words, <em>Woman, thou art delivered; </em>for he authoritatively declares that deliverance was at his own disposal, and employs, at the same time, the outward sign, the use of which we have explained on a former occasion. </p></div>
