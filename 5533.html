<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若遇见人拐带以色列中的一个弟兄，当奴才待他，或是卖了他，那拐带人的就必治死。这样，便将那恶从你们中间除掉。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The same punishment is here deservedly denounced against man-stealers as against murderers; for, so wretched was the condition of slaves, that liberty was more than half of life; and hence to deprive a man of such a great blessing, was almost to destroy him. Besides, it is not man-stealing only which is here condemned, but the accompanying evils of cruelty and fraud, <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>. , if he, who had stolen a man, had likewise sold him. Now, such a sale could hardly be made among the people themselves, without the crime being immediately detected; and nothing could be more hateful than that God’s children should be alienated from the Church, and delivered over to heathen nations. </p></div>
