<div class="comment-content"><p>He mentions two things in the close: “See that our brethren behold your love,” and secondly, “Take care, that it be not in vain that I have boasted of you.” For <span class="lang el-gr">αὐτούς </span> (<em>to them</em>,) appears to me to be equivalent to <em>coram ipsis </em><em>, </em>(<em>before them,</em>) for this clause does not refer to the poor, but to the messengers of whom mention had been made. <span class="cite-ref">(702)</span> For he immediately afterwards subjoins, that they would not be alone witnesses, but in consequence of the report given by them, a report would go out even to distant Churches. </p><p><strong>(702)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui estoyent enuoyez comme ambassadeurs vers les Corinthiens</span>;” — “Who had been sent as ambassadors to the Corinthians.” </p></div>
