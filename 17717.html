<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们的面色证明自己的不正。他们述说自己的罪恶，并不隐瞒，好像所多玛一样。他们有祸了。因为作恶自害。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>The proof of their countenance will answer in them, </em>or, <em>will answer against them </em><span class="cite-ref">(59)</span> As the Prophet had to do with impudent and brazen-faced hypocrites, who impudently boasted that they were good men; so he says that their countenance testifies what kind of persons they are, and that it will not be necessary to bring witnesses from a distance, in order to prove their wickedness; for <em>to answer </em>means “to bear testimony,” or “to confess.” Although, therefore, they disguise their face and countenance, so that they frequently deceive others, yet God compels them to show and prove what they are; so that, in spite of themselves they carry, as it were, in their forehead a mark of their deceit and hypocrisy. </p><p>Some explain it, that their crimes are so manifest that they cannot avoid seeing, as in a mirror, the baseness which they desire to conceal But the former meaning is confirmed by what immediately follows, that they <em>declared their sin in the same manner as the inhabitants of Sodom</em>. By these words he intimates that they devoted themselves to iniquity in such a manner, that they boasted of their transgressions without any shame; as if it had been honorable and praiseworthy in them to trample on every distinction between right and wrong, and not to indulge in every kind of wickedness. On this account he compares them to the inhabitants of <em>Sodom</em>, (<span class="bvs">Gen_18:20</span>,) who were so much blinded by their lusts, that they rushed, with brutish stupidity, to everything base. So, then, this is<em>the answer of the countenance</em>, which he mentioned a little before, that they carry about with them plain tokens of impiety, which are abundantly sufficient to prove their guilt. </p><p><em>Woe unto their soul! </em>Here he declares what was formerly mentioned, that the whole cause of their calamities is to be found in themselves; for by their sins and iniquities they provoked the Lord; and consequently that they have no means of evasion, that it is useless to contrive idle pretenses, because the evil itself dwells in their bones; as if he had said, “God cannot be accused, as if he punished you unjustly. Acknowledge that it has been done by yourselves; give glory to a righteous judge and lay the whole blame on yourselves.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(59)</span> See p. 122. </p></div></div>
