<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">说，我情愿与非利士人同死。就尽力屈身，房子倒塌，压住首领和房内的众人。这样，参孙死时所杀的人，比活着所杀的还多。</div></div>
