<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣问她说，妇人，为什么哭？你找谁呢？马利亚以为是看园的，就对他说，先生，若是你把他移了去，请告诉我，你把他放在哪里，我便去取他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Lord, if thou hast carried him hence. </em>She calls him <em>Lord, </em>according to the custom of her nation; for the same appellation, <em>Lord, </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">Κύριε</span><span class="cite-ref">(198)</span>) is employed by the Hebrews in addressing laborers and other persons of low condition. We see that Mary has no view of this matter but what is earthly. She desires only to obtain the dead body of Christ, that she may keep it hidden in the sepulcher; but she leaves out the most important matter, the elevation of her mind to the divine power of his resurrection. We need not wonder, therefore, if such grovelling views place a veil before her eyes. </p><p><strong>(198)</strong> The salutation, <span class="lang el-gr">Κύριε</span> was addressed to persons of various ranks, and answers to the modern term, <em>Sir. </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
