<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约坦与亚扪人的王打仗胜了他们，当年他们进贡银一百他连得，小麦一万歌珥，大麦一万歌珥。第二年，第三年也是这样。</div></div>
