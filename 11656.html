<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但王的女儿约示巴将亚哈谢的儿子约阿施从那被杀的王子中偷出来，把他和他的乳母都藏在卧房里。约示巴是约兰王的女儿，亚哈谢的妹子，祭司耶何耶大的妻。她收藏约阿施，躲避亚他利雅，免得被杀。</div></div>
