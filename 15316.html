<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你的忿怒重压我身。你用一切的波浪困住我。（细拉）</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Some translate the first clause of the 7<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, <em>Thy indignation hath approached upon me; </em>and the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">סמך</span>, <em>samach, </em>is sometimes to be taken in this sense. But from the scope of the passage, it must necessarily be understood here, as in many other places, in the sense of <em>to surround, </em>or <em>to lie heavy upon; </em>for when the subject spoken of is a man sunk into a threefold grave, it would be too feeble to speak of the wrath of God as merely approaching him. The translation which I have adopted is peculiarly suitable to the whole drift of the text. It views the prophet as declaring, that he sustained the whole burden of God’s wrath; seeing <em>he was afflicted with His waves. </em>Farther, as so dreadful a flood did not prevent him from lifting up his heart and prayers to God, we may learn from his example to cast the anchor of our faith and prayers direct into heaven in all the perils of shipwreck to which we may be exposed. </p></div>
