<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">乐意接待远人，好善，庄重，公平，圣洁，自持。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>But hospitable, devoted to kindness </em>Hence it is evident how destructive is that plague which tears the Church by quarrels. With this vice he contrasts, first, docility, and next, gentleness and modesty towards all; for a bishop will never teach well, who is not also ready to learn. Augustine praises highly a saying of Cyprian: “Let him be as patient to learn as skillful to teach.” Besides, bishops often need advice and warnings. If they refuse to be admonished, if they reject good advices, they will immediately fall headlong to the grievous injury of the Church. The remedy against these evils, therefore, is, that they be not wise to themselves. </p><p>I have chosen to translate<span class="lang el-gr">φιλάγαθον</span><em>devoted to kindness, </em>rather than with Erasmus, “a lover of good things;” for this virtue, accompanied by hospitality, appears to be contrasted by Paul with covetousness and niggardliness. He calls that man <em>just, </em>who lives among men without doing harm to any one. <em>Holiness </em>has reference to God; for even Plato draws this distinction between the two words. </p></div>
