<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_6:39</span><strong>.</strong><em>And he spake to them a parable. </em>Luke relates this saying without mentioning any occurrence, but states generally, that Christ made use of this <em>parable; </em>as in recording many of Christ’s discourses he says nothing as to the occasion on which they were delivered. It is no doubt possible that Christ may have spoken this parable more than once; but, as no place more appropriate was to be found, I have not hesitated to insert here what Luke relates without fixing the time. </p></div>
