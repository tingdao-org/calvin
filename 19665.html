<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">祭司西番雅就把这信念给先知耶利米听。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>It follows, <em>And Zephaniah had read, etc </em>The past perfect tense is more suitable here, for the verse ought to be put in a parenthesis. The Prophet obviates a doubt which might have been entertained. He then shews how the prophecy was made known to him; he was one of the hearers when the letter was read. And it is probable that the priest called Jeremiah on purpose, that he might be proved guilty by his own accuser. However this may have been, he wished to expose the holy man to the hatred of the people, or rather to their fury. The constancy of Jeremiah was worthy of greater praise, while he boldly reproved the arrogance of them all, who had nothing else in view but to suppress God’s truth by force and tyranny. </p></div>
