<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约翰为他作见证，喊着说，这就是我曾说，那在我以后来的，反成了在我以前的。因他本来在我以前。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>John testifieth</em>. He now relates what was the preaching of John. By using the verb <em>testifieth </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">μαρτυρεῖ</span>) in the present tense, <span class="cite-ref">(27)</span> he denotes a continued act, and certainly this doctrine must be continually in force, as if the voice of John were continually resounding in the ears of men. In the same manner he afterwards uses the word <em>cry</em>, to intimate that the doctrine of John was in no degree obscure or ambiguous, and that he did not mutter among a few men, <span class="cite-ref">(28)</span> but openly, and with a loud voice, preached Christ. The first sentence is intended to convey the statement, that he was sent for the sake of Christ, and therefore that it would have been unreasonable that he should be exalted, while Christ was lying low. </p><p><em>This is he of whom I spoke</em>. By these words he means that his intention was, from the beginning, to make Christ known, and that this was the design of his public discourses; as, indeed, there was no other way in which he could discharge his office as ambassador than by calling his disciples to Christ. </p><p><em>Who, coming after me</em>. Though John the Baptist was older than Christ by a few months, yet he does not now speak of age; but as he had discharged the office of prophet for a short period before Christ appeared in public, so he makes himself the predecessor with respect to time. With respect, therefore, to public manifestation, Christ <em>came after </em>John the Baptist. The words which follow might be literally rendered, <em>he was made before me</em>, <em>for he was before me</em>; but the meaning is, that Christ was justly <em>preferred to </em>John, <em>because he was more excellent</em>. He therefore surrenders his office to Christ and — as the proverb runs — “delivers to him the torch,” or gives way to him as his successor. But as he arose later in the order of time, John reminds his hearers that this is no reason why he should not be <em>preferred to </em>himself, as his rank deserved. Thus, all who are superior to others, either in the gifts of God or in any degree of honor, must remain in their own rank, so as to be placed below Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(27)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En usant du verbe du temps present, a scavoir, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Rend </em><span class="lang fr-fr">tesmoignage, et on pas, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Rendoit </em>;” — “by using the verb in the present tense, giveth <em>testimony</em>, and not gave <em>testimony</em>. ” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(28)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il n’a point parle entre ses dents, et communique la chose comme en secret a peu de gens</span>;” — “that he did not speak between his teeth, and communicate the matter, as it were secretly, to a few persons.” </p></div></div>
