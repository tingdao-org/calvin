<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">功用也有分别，神却是一位，在众人里面运行一切的事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>One God that worketh. </em>Where we use the word <em>powers </em>the Greek term is <span class="lang el-gr">ἐνεργήματα</span><em>, </em>a term which contains an allusion to the verb <em>worketh, </em>as in Latin <em>effectus </em> (an effect) corresponds with the verb <em>effectus </em> (to effect.) Paul’s meaning is, that although believers may be endowed with different powers, they all take their rise from one and the same power on the part of God. Hence the expression employed here — <em>worketh all things in all </em>— does not refer to the general providence of God, but to the liberality that he exercises towards us, in bestowing upon every one some gift. The sum is this — that there is nothing in mankind that is good or praiseworthy but what comes from God alone. Hence it is out of place here to agitate the question — in what manner God acts in Satan and in reprobates. </p></div>
