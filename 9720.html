<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王夜间起来，对臣仆说，我告诉你们亚兰人向我们如何行。他们知道我们饥饿，所以离营，埋伏在田野，说，以色列人出城的时候，我们就活捉他们，得以进城。</div></div>
