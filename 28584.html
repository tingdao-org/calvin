<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>For we are one bread. </em>I have already stated above, that it was not Paul’s particular design here to exhort us to love, but he mentions this by the way, that the Corinthians may understand that we must, even by external profession, maintain that unity which subsists between us and Christ, inasmuch as we all assemble together to receive the symbol of that sacred unity. In this second part of the statement, he makes mention only of the one part of the Sacrament, and it is the manner of Scripture to describe by Synecdoche <span class="cite-ref">(577)</span> the entire Supper by <em>the breaking of bread </em>It is necessary to warn my readers, in passing, as to this, lest any less experienced person should be put off his guard by the foolish cavil that is brought forward by certain sycophants — as if Paul, by mentioning merely the bread, had it in view to deprive the people of the one half of the Sacrament. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(577)</span> A figure of speech in which a part is put for the whole. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
