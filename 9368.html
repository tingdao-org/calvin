<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们将所得的牛犊预备好了，从早晨到午间，求告巴力的名说，巴力阿，求你应允我们。却没有声音，没有应允的。他们在所筑的坛四围踊跳。</div></div>
