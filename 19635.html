<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以耶和华如此说，看哪，我要叫你去世，你今年必死，因为你向耶和华说了叛逆的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here is added the punishment which confirmed the prophecy of <em>Jeremiah; </em>for it was God’s purpose to have regard to the ignorance of many who would have otherwise stumbled, or made their ignorance a pretext, for they could not determine which of the two had been sent by God, Hananiah or Jeremiah. It was then God’s design, in his paternal indulgence, to stretch forth his hand to them, and also in an especial manner to render inexcusable the unbelieving who had already given themselves up, as it were, to the devil; for the greater part were not moved by an event, so memorable; <span class="cite-ref">(200)</span> for it follows immediately, — </p><p><strong>(200)</strong> The last clause of this verse is not here explained. Calvin’s version is, “revolt hast thou spoken against Jehovah;” the Vulg., “against the Lord hast thou spoken;” the Syr., “iniquity hast thou spoken before the Lord;” and the Targ., “perverseness hast thou spoken before Jehovah.” Blayney’s version is, “thou hast spoken prevarication concerning Jehovah.” Gataker renders it the same with Calvin, and explains it thus, — “Because by thy lying tales thou hast heartened and encouraged men to stand out against God’s word, and against his admonitions and menaces by his prophets.” Henry gives the same view. </p><p>Blayney says that, <span class="lang he-il">סרה</span> properly signifies declining or turning aside from the straight path, the path of truth and right, and that here it means the presumption of uttering as a revelation from God what a man knew to be not so. The same phrase occurs in two other places, <span class="bvs">Deu_13:5</span>; <span class="bvs">Jer_29:32</span>. The <span class="lang he-il">אל</span> here before Jehovah is <span class="lang he-il">על</span> in several MSS.; but the prepositions are sometimes the same. The rendering that would suit the three places would be the following: — “For of turning aside hast thou spoken contrary to Jehovah,” that is, to his expressed will or command. The meaning might be thus conveyed, — “for thou hast encouraged disobedience contrary to the express command of God.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
