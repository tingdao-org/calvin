<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约伯的三个朋友提幔人以利法，书亚人比勒达，拿玛人琐法，听说有这一切的灾祸临到他身上，各人就从本处约会同来，为他悲伤，安慰他。</div></div>
