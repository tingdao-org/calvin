<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">求你看顾我的苦难，搭救我，因我不忘记你的律法。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>153.</strong><em>Behold my affliction and rescue me. </em>The Psalmist teaches by his own example that those who are devoted to the service and fear of God, must not be discouraged though they are not rewarded for it in this world. Their condition upon earth is one of warfare, and therefore they should not be dismayed by diversity, but rather rest satisfied with the consolatory consideration, that the gate of prayer is open to them. Yet the Prophet does not boast of his, endeavors to keep the law, as if he would have God to pay him wages for his service, but only to show that he was one of God’s servants, just as he has spoken of his hope that he was so in other places. This reason, <em>for I have not forgotten thy law, </em>on account of which he beseeches God to consider his affliction and to rescue him, is peculiarly forcible in the present case; for it is an evidence of no ordinary courage when, instead of being led away from the fear of God by adversity, we wrestle against temptations and seek him even when he seems purposely to drive us away from him. </p></div>
