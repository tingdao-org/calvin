<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>He was raised up from the earth. </em>Luke addeth now, that he was taken with so great fear that he could not rise of himself; and not that only, but he was also blind for a time, that he might forget his former wit and wiliness. <span class="cite-ref">(580)</span> When as he saith, that <em>after that his eyes were opened, he saw not, </em>it seemeth that it doth not agree with the other words which shall follow by and by, that his eyes were covered, as it were, with scales; but the meaning of this place is, that he was blind indeed, and deprived of his sight for that three days; because when he opened his eyes he saw nothing. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(580)</span> “Acumen,” acumen. </p></div></div>
