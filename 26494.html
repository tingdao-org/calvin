<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>The hireling fleeth. </em>The reason is, <em>because he careth not for the sheep</em>, which means, that his heart is not moved by the scattering of the flock, because he thinks that it does not at all belong to him. For he who looks to the <em>hire</em>, and not to the flock, though he may deceive others, when the Church is in a state of tranquillity, yet when he comes into the contest, will give proof of his treachery. </p></div>
