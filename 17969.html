<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>The cry is gone round about the borders of Moab. </em><span class="cite-ref">(245)</span><span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, (<em>ki</em>,) <em>for</em>, is added for the sake of ornament. He means that every part of that country all around shall be full of <em>crying </em>and <em>howling</em>; because that destruction reaches from one extremity to another. Besides the <em>crying </em>he twice mentions the <em>howling</em>, to denote the excess of grief, as men who are in despair surrender themselves entirely to lamentation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(245)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
