<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列家阿，至于你们，主耶和华如此说，从此以后若不听从我，就任凭你们去事奉偶像，只是不可再因你们的供物和偶像亵渎我的圣名。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now again God expressly bears witness that he rejects the Israelites because they infected the pure worship of the law with their mixtures; for we said that they were deceived by a vain imagination when they thought God pleased with their obedience, while they worshipped him only half-heartedly. When they heaped up fictions, they thought this diligence would be pleasing to God, because they professed to acknowledge the true God as their redeemer. Here again he announces that he rejects all half-worship, since he wished to have the entire affections, and to admit no rival: <em>Now, </em>says he<em>, O house of Israel, thus says Jehovah, Go each of you and serve your idols</em>, just as if he would cast them off from his family. And yet we see that they were always under his dominion; and thus some kind of inconsistency arises when God rejects them from his sway, and yet retains them as his right. But the liberty which is now granted is to show them that it is in vain to worship God by halves. </p><p>This passage is peculiarly remarkable, since at this time many are deceived, while they rest upon their own inventions, and think that they best discharge their duty towards God when they partially obey his commandments, and then pile up a great heap of superstitions, partly received from their fathers and partly fabricated by themselves. Again, scarcely one in a hundred will be found who does not think it better partially to worship God than entirely to devote themselves to idols; and this indeed is true as far as man is concerned; for the impiety is more foul and detestable when men openly reject God, and divorce themselves from him, and devote themselves to idols, than if they partly worshipped God and partly idols. But in the meantime, we see that God pronounces that he cannot bear this profanation; and we must diligently notice the reason which is added; for when gross and palpable impiety is indulged in, God’s name is not so profaned as when clever men reconcile the pure worship of God with superstitions: and for this reason, that monstrous Indecision <span class="cite-ref">(292)</span> was in God’s sight worse than the papacy; and why so? for although the papists profane God’s name, yet their madness is at present so detected, that it openly appears that they are idolaters; but that invention mingled darkness with light, and infected the pure doctrine with its leaven. But God here exclaims that he could not endure this deception when men profess to worship him, for they defile themselves with superstitions, since profaneness is added to impiety, and both are the result of hypocrisy. The rest tomorrow. </p><p><strong>(292)</strong> Calvin’s language is here rather remarkable. He calls the clinging to the worship of God, while bowing down to idols, <em>illud prodigiosum </em>Interim, which is in the French translation <em class="lang fr-fr">ce beau monstre </em><span class="lang fr-fr">D’interim</span>. The same idea is also expressed by the word <em>commentum </em>, translated <em class="lang fr-fr">ceste belle invention ainsi forgee </em>. </p></div>
