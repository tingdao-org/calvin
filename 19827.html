<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我就将哈巴洗尼雅的孙子雅利米雅的儿子雅撒尼亚和他弟兄，并他众子，以及利甲全族的人，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now the Prophet adds that he <em>took Jaazaniah, </em>who was a chief man, and as it were the head of the family. And he names his father, even <em>Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah; </em>and he then says, <em>his whole house </em>It is added, that he <em>brought them into the Temple, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God </em>The Prophet no doubt chose a well-known place, that the report of this might spread through the whole city, and even throughout Judea, and also that the dignity of the place might add credit to the report; for we know that when a thing is done in an obscure corner, it may be regarded as doubtful or fabulous. But the Prophet brought the Rechabites into an honorable place, even <em>into the chamber of the sons of Hanan </em>And he afterwards says, that he was <em>the son of Igdaliah, a man of God </em>Doubtless such was the reverence in which this man was held, that no one dared to call into question what had been done there. Then he adds that the <em>chamber was nigh the chamber of the princes, which was over the chamber of the keeper of the treasury </em>Some render the last word, “the entrance,” <span class="cite-ref">(99)</span> the word means a vessel; and it signifies here the sacred furniture; and there is a change of number, for this word included all the vessels of the Temple. We hence see that the place was select, superior to other places, so that it might be as a notable theater, and that the prophecy might thus gain more credit among all the Jews. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(99)</span> So the <em>Sept., </em>the <em>Vulg., </em>and the <em>Syr.; </em>and the word, <span class="lang he-il">סף</span>, has commonly this meaning, a porch, an entrance or a threshold. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
