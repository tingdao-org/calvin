<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong>. He now recommends, from the example of Christ, the exercise of humility, to which he had exhorted them in words. There are, however, two departments, in the <em>first </em>of which he invites us to imitate Christ, because this is the rule of life: <span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> in the <em>second</em>, he allures us to it, because this is the road by which we attain true glory. Hence he exhorts every one to have the same disposition that was in Christ. He afterwards shews what a pattern of humility has been presented before us in Christ. I have retained the passive form of the verb, though I do not disapprove of the rendering given it by others, because there is no difference as to meaning. I merely wished that the reader should be in possession of the very form of expression which Paul has employed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(102)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pourceque l’imitation d’ iceluy est la regle de bien viure</span>;” — “Because imitation of him is the rule of right living.” </p></div></div>
