<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">非利士人的首领向亚吉发怒，对他说，你要叫这人回你所安置他的地方，不可叫他同我们出战，恐怕他在阵上反为我们的敌人。他用什么与他主人复和呢？岂不是用我们这些人的首级吗？</div></div>
