<div class="CUV verse">说，我们要挣开他们的捆绑，脱去他们的绳索。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Let us break, etc</em>. This is a prosopopoeia, <span class="cite-ref">(25)</span> in which the prophet introduces his-enemies as speaking; and he employs this figure the better to express their ungodly and traitorous design. Not that they openly avowed themselves rebels against God, (for they rather covered their rebellion under every possible pretext, and presumptuously boasted of having God on their side;) but since they were fully determined, by all means, fair or foul, to drive David from the throne, whatever they professed with the mouth, the whole of their consultation amounted to this, how they might overthrow the kingdom which God himself had set up. When he describes his government under the metaphorical expressions of bonds, and a yoke, on the persons of his adversaries, he indirectly condemns their pride. For he represents them speaking scornfully of his government, as if to submit to it were a slavish and shameful subjection, just as we see it is with all the enemies of Christ who, when compelled to be subject to his authority reckon it not less degrading than if the utmost disgrace were put upon them. </p><p><strong>(25)</strong> A rhetoric figure, in which persons or things are feigned or supposed to speak; a personification. </p></div>
