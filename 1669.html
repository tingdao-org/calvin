<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华吩咐摩西，亚伦往以色列人和埃及王法老那里去，把以色列人从埃及地领出来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And the Lord spake unto Moses. </em>I translate it, “the Lord had spoken unto Moses;” because reference is here made to the commencement of his calling, and, therefore, the sense will be more accurately rendered by the <em>perfect past </em>tense; for he repeats, what he had already said, that he and Aaron his brother had not acted rashly, but had been commissioned by the command of God. The drift is, that however often the work might have been in some way interrupted, the counsel of God still held firm for the liberation of the people. But it is evident that he speaks of the first command, because he says that he and his brother were sent as well to the children of Israel as to Pharaoh. </p></div>
