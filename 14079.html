<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">免得我的仇敌说，我胜了他。免得我的敌人在我摇动的时候喜乐。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Lest my enemy. </em>David again repeats what he had a little before said concerning the pride of his enemies, namely, how it would be a thing ill becoming the character of God were he to abandon his servant to the mockery of the ungodly. David’s enemies lay, as it were, in ambush watching the hour of his ruin, that they might deride him when they saw him fall. And as it is the peculiar office of God to repress the audacity and insolence of the wicked, as often as they glory in their wickedness, David beseeches God to deprive them of the opportunity of indulging in such boasting. It is, however, to be observed, that he had in his conscience a sufficient testimony to his own integrity, and that he trusted also in the goodness of his cause, so that it would have been unbecoming and unreasonable had he been left without succor in danger, and had he been overwhelmed by his enemies. We can, therefore, with confidence pray for ourselves, in the manner in which David here does for himself, only when we fight under the standard of God, and are obedient to his orders, so that our enemies cannot obtain the victory over us without wickedly triumphing over God himself. </p></div>
