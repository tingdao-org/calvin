<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这样，你们就不污秽所住之地，因为血是污秽地的。若有在地上流人血的，非流那杀人者的血，那地就不得洁净（洁净原文作赎）。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>So ye shall not pollute the land</em>. In this concluding sentence, He again reminds them that, unless they should exercise severe justice against murderers, they would be guilty of sin against God; because the land stained with human blood is polluted, and lying under His curse, until expiation has been made. Again, since God dwells in the land of Canaan, having chosen His abode among the children of Israel, his sanctity is also profaned. The sum is, that, in every respect, care should be taken lest the land, which is sacred to God, should be contaminated by bloodshed. </p></div>
