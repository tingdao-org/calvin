<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">叫他们看是看见，却不晓得。听是听见，却不明白。恐怕他们回转过来，就得赦免。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_4:12</span><strong>.</strong><em>That seeing, they may see, and not perceive. </em>Here it may suffice to state briefly what has already been fully explained, that the doctrine is not, strictly speaking, or by itself, or in its own nature, but by accident, the cause of blindness. When persons of a weak sight come out into sunshine, their eyes become dimmer than before, and that defect is in no way attributed to the sun, but to their eyes. In like manner, when the word of God blinds and hardens the reprobate, as this takes place through their own depravity, it belongs truly and naturally to themselves, but is accidental, as respects the word. </p><p><em>Lest at any time they should be converted. </em>This clause points out the advantage that is gained by <em>seeing and understanding </em>It is, that men, having been <em>converted </em>to God, are restored to his favor, and, being reconciled to him, enjoy prosperity and happiness. The true end for which </p><p>God desires that his word should be preached is, to reconcile men to himself by renewing their minds and hearts. With respect to the reprobate, on the other hand, Isaiah here declares that the stony hardness remains in them, so that they do not obtain mercy, and that the word fails to produce its effect upon them, so as to soften their minds to repentance. </p></div>
