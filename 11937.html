<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他作王第八年，尚且年幼，就寻求他祖大卫的神。到了十二年才洁净犹大和耶路撒冷，除掉丘坛，木偶，雕刻的像，和铸造的像。</div></div>
