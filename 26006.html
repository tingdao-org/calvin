<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们彼此谈论所遇见的这一切事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And they were conversing with each other. </em>It was a proof of godliness that they endeavored to cherish their faith in Christ: though small and weak; for their <em>conversation </em>had no other object than to employ their reverence for their Master as a shield against the offense of the cross. Now though their questions and disputes showed an ignorance which was worthy of reproof — since, after having been informed that the resurrection of Christ would take place, they were astonished at hearing it mentioned—still their docility afforded Christ an opportunity of removing their error. For many persons intentionally put questions, because they have resolved obstinately to reject the truth; but when men are desirous to embrace the truth submissively, though they may waver on account of very small objections, and stop at slight difficulties, their holy desire to obey God finds favor in his sight, so that he stretches out his hand to them, brings them to full conviction, and does not permit them to remain irresolute. We ought, at least, to hold it as certain, that when we inquire about Christ, if this be done from a modest desire to learn, the door is opened for him to assist us; <em>nay, </em>we may almost say that we then call for himself to be our Teacher; as irreligious men, by their unholy speeches, drive him to a distance from them. </p></div>
