<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚哈谢藏在撒玛利亚，耶户寻找他，众人将他拿住，送到耶户那里，就杀了他，将他葬埋。因他们说，他是那尽心寻求耶和华之约沙法的儿子。这样，亚哈谢的家无力保守国权。</div></div>
