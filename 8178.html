<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大卫回家要给眷属祝福。扫罗的女儿米甲出来迎接他，说，以色列王今日在臣仆的婢女眼前露体，如同一个轻贱人无耻露体一样，有好大的荣耀阿。</div></div>
