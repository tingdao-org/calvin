<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这风声传到埃及，埃及人为推罗的风声，极其疼痛。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>As soon as the report shall reach the Egyptians. </em><span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> In this verse he declares that this destruction will affect equally the inhabitants of Tyre and those of Egypt; and this confirms the exposition which we follow, that the present prophecy relates to a former devastation. The inhabitants of Tyre had been in alliance with the Egyptians, and both countries had been under kingly government; not as in Alexander’s time, when Tyre was a free state, and lived under its own laws. The alliance which existed between the inhabitants of Tyre and those of Egypt could not have been more appropriately described; and therefore he shews that this ruin extends also to the Egyptians, because they prompted the Jews to rebellion, and turned them aside from confidence in God. The former were open enemies; the latter, under the pretense of friendship, cherished dangerous hostility; and therefore both are justly punished. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(106)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
