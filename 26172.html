<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">妇人说，先生，请把这水赐给我，叫我不渴，也不用来这么远打水。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Give me this water. </em>This woman undoubtedly is sufficiently aware that Christ is speaking of spiritual water; but because she despises him, she sets at naught all his promises; for so long as the authority of him who speaks is not acknowledged by us, his doctrine is not permitted to enter. Indirectly, therefore, the woman taunted Christ, saying, “Thou boastest much, but I see nothing: show it in reality, if thou canst.” </p></div>
