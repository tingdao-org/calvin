<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">尼探雅的儿子以实玛利杀了亚希甘的儿子基大利，从米斯巴将剩下的一切百姓，兵丁，妇女，孩童，太监掳到基遍之后，加利亚的儿子约哈难和同着他的众军长将他们都夺回来，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet now shews, that though some kind of virtue appeared in John the son of Kareah, he was not yet of a right mind. He was an energetic and a <em>discreet </em>man, but he discovered his unbelief, when he led the remnant of the people into Egypt, while the Prophet was forbidding such a thing. He already knew that this was not lawful, but his obstinacy was two-fold more, when the Prophet repudiated his project, as we shall see. This passage then teaches us, that though the leaders of the forces, who had put Ishmael to flight, and avenged his perfidy, were men of courage, and shewed regard for the public good, they were destitute of faith: there was thus wanting in them the chief thing, that is piety and the fear of God. </p><p>Then the Prophet says, that <em>John </em>and the rest <em>took the remnant of the people whom they had recovered from Ishmael, from Mizpah, </em>not that they were recovered from that place, but that Ishmael had brought the unhappy people captives from Mizpah, as we have seen; but they had all been recovered at Gibeon, according to what is said at the end of the verse. But he says that they were <em>valiant men, </em><span class="lang he-il">גברים</span><em>, geberim, </em>(he so calls them on account of their courage, for an explanation follows,) and men <em>of war, </em><span class="lang he-il">המלחמה אנשי</span><em>, anushi emelecheme. </em>He then calls them <em>valiant </em>or brave, and afterwards he explains what that virtue was, even because they were warlike men. He says further, that there were <em>women </em>mixed with them, and <em>children, </em>and <em>eunuchs, </em>who once lived in the king’s court; and as we have before seen, there were among them the king’s daughters. Gedaliah then had collected together a considerable number of men, not only from the lower orders, but also from the higher class, whose wealth and rank were not common while the kingdom was standing. </p></div>
