<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">有一个人，名叫西门，向来在那城里行邪术，妄自尊大，使撒玛利亚的百姓惊奇。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>A certain man named Simon. </em>This was such a let that it might seem that the gospel could have no passage to come unto the Samaritans; for the minds of them all were bewitched with Simon’s jugglings. And this amazedness was grown to some strength by reason of long space of time. Furthermore experience teacheth what a hard matter it is to pluck that error out of the minds of men which hath taken root through long continuance and to call them back unto a sound and right mind who are already hardened. Superstition made them more obstinate in their error, because they counted Simon not only as a prophet of God, but even as the Spirit of God. </p></div>
