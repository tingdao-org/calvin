<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣又到了加利利的迦拿，就是他从前变水为酒的地方。有一个大臣，他的儿子在迦百农患病。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>And there was a certain courtier. </em>This is a more correct rendering, though Erasmus thinks differently, who has translated <span class="lang el-gr">βασιλικός</span> by a Latin word, <em>Regulus</em>, which means a little king. <span class="cite-ref">(89)</span> I acknowledge indeed that, at that time, they gave the name of <em>Reguli </em>(or, <em>little kings</em>) to those who are now called Dukes, or Barons, or Earls; but the state of Galilee at that time was such that there could be no person of that rank dwelling in Capernaum. I think that he was some nobleman <span class="cite-ref">(90)</span> of the court of Herod; for there is some plausibility in the opinion of those who think that he was sent by Caesar. <span class="cite-ref">(91)</span> This is expressly mentioned by the Evangelist, because the rank of this personage made the miracle the more illustrious. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(89)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lequel l’a traduit par un mot Latin </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Regulus</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, qui signifie un petit Roy</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(90)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelque gentil-homme</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(91)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Par l’Empereur</span>;” — “by the Emperor.” </p></div></div>
