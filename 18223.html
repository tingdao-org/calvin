<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们必因那不利于他们的民蒙羞。那民并非帮助，也非利益，只作羞耻凌辱。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>They shall all be ashamed. </em>He confirms the former statement; for it was very difficult to convince ungodly men that all that they undertook without the word of God would be ruinous to them. In order to punish them more severely, God sometimes bestows on them prosperity, that they may be more and more deceived, and may throw themselves down headlong; for by the righteous judgment of God it is brought about, that Satan draws them by these allurements, and drives them into his nets. Yet the final result is, that not only are they deprived of the assistance which they expected, but they are likewise severely punished both for their presumption and for their unbelief. </p><p><em>Of a people that will not profit them. </em>He threatens not only that the Egyptians will prove false, as wicked men often forsake at the utmost need, or even treacherously ruin, those whom they have fed with empty promises, but that even though they endeavor to the utmost to fulfill the promises which they have made, still they will be of no use. Whatever may be the earnestness with which men endeavor to help us, yet, as events are in the hand of God, they will “profit nothing” without his blessing. It was difficult to believe when the Prophet spoke, that a nation so powerful could yield no assistance; but we ought always to hold it as a principle fully settled, that all the advantage that dazzles us in the world will vanish away, except in so far as God is gracious and kind, and makes it sure for our advantage. </p></div>
