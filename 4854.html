<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列人所得的地业从中要把些城邑给利未人。人多的就多给，人少的就少给。各支派要按所承受为业之地把城邑给利未人。</div></div>
