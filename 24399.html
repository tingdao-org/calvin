<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_5:34</span><strong>.</strong><em>Go in peace, and be delivered from thy scourge. </em>From this exhortation we infer that the benefit which she had obtained was fully ratified, when she heard from the lips of Christ what she had already learned from experience: for we do not truly, or with a safe conscience, enjoy God’s benefits in any other way than by possessing them as contained in the treasury of his promises. </p></div>
