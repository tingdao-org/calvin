<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">及至家主起来关了门，你们站在外面叩门，说，主阿，给我们开门，他就回答说，我不认识你们，不晓得你们是哪里来的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_13:25</span><strong>.</strong><em>And when the master of the house shall have arisen </em>Though these words, as I hinted a little before, were spoken on a different and later occasion, I have chosen to pay more regard to the doctrine than to the time: for it is no slight assistance to the understanding to read, in immediate connection, those passages which are closely related in meaning. As Christ had declared that to many, who shall desire to enter into heaven, the door will not be open, he now asserts, that they gain nothing by occupying a place in the church because God will at length arise in judgment, and shut out from his kingdom those who now lay claim to a place in his family. He employs the comparison of the <em>master of a house, </em>who, having learned that some wicked and dissolute persons among his own domestics steal out unperceived during the night, and expose the house to thieves, <em>rises and shuts the door, </em>and does not allow those night-prowlers to enter, who have been wandering through the public streets at unseasonable hours. By these words he warns us, that we must avail ourselves of the opportunity, while it is offered: for so long as the Lord invites us to himself, the <em>door </em>is, as it were, open, that we may enter into the kingdom of heaven: but the greater part do not deign to move a step. Christ therefore threatens, that <em>the door </em>will at length be <em>shut, </em>and that those who are looking for companions are in danger of being refused admission. </p></div>
