<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">摩西对可拉说，明天，你和你一党的人，并亚伦，都要站在耶和华面前。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And Moses said unto Korah. </em>The idea of Moses is not to make an experiment as if in a doubtful matter; but, being assured by the Spirit of prophecy what the event would be, he summons Korah before the tribunal of God, that he may receive the sentence of condemnation which he deserves. Nor does he inveigle him so as to destroy him unawares, but rather still endeavors to cure his madness, if it were possible to do so. For the sacred incense-offering was calculated to inspire him with alarm, lest, by rashly attempting more than was lawful, he should effect his own destruction, especially after so memorable an example had been made in the case of Nadab and Abihu. Moses, however, in reliance on God’s command, does not hesitate to engage in an open contest, in order that the judgment of God might be the more conspicuous. </p></div>
