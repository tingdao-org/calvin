<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">弟兄们，这却怎么样呢？你们聚会的时候，各人或有诗歌，或有教训，或有启示，或有方言，或有翻出来的话。凡事都当造就人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>What is it then? </em>He now shows the way in which they may remedy those evils. In the first place, each gift must have its place, but in order and in measure. Farther, the Church must not be taken up to no purpose with unprofitable exercises, but must, in whatever is done, have an eye to edification. He speaks, however, in the first place of edification in this way: “Let every one, according as he has been endowed with some particular gift, make it his aim to lay it out for the advantage of all.” For it is in this way that we must understand the word rendered <em>every one </em>— <em>that </em>no one may take it as implying universality, as though all to a man were endowed with some such gift. </p></div>
