<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在那些日子，我要将我的灵浇灌我的仆人和使女，他们就要说预言。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Upon my servants. </em>In these words the promise is restrained unto the worshippers of God. For God doth not profane his Spirit; which he should do, if he should make the stone common to the unbelieving and despisers. It is certain that we are made the servants of God by the Spirit; and that, therefore, we are not, until such time as we have received the same; but, first, whom God hath adopted to be of his family, and whom he hath framed by his Spirit to obey him, those doth he furnish with new gifts afterward. Again, the prophet did not respect that order of thee, but his meaning was to make this grace proper to the Church alone. And forasmuch as the Church was only among the Jews, he calleth them honorably the servants and handmaids of God. But after that God did gather unto himself on every side a Church, the wall of separation being pulled down, so many as are received into the society of the covenant are called by the same name. Only let us remember, that the Spirit is appointed for the Church properly. </p></div>
