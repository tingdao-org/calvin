<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>God will surely visit you</em>. By these words he intimates that they would be buried as in oblivion, so long as they remained in Egypt: and truly that exile was as if God had turned his back on them for a season. Nevertheless, Joseph does not cease to fix the eyes of his mind on God; as it is written in the Prophet, </p><p>“I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face <LineBreak />from the house of Jacob.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_8:17</span>.) </p><p>This passage also clearly teaches what was the design of this anxious choice of his sepulcher, namely, that it might be a seal of redemption: for after he has asserted that God was faithful, and would, in his own time, grant what he had promised, he immediately adjures his brethren to carry away his bones. These were useful relics, the sight of which plainly signified that, by the death of men, the eternal covenant in which Joseph commands his posterity safely to rest, had by no means become extinct; for he deems it sufficient to adduce the oath of God, to remove all their doubts respecting their deliverance. </p><p>End of the Commentaries on the first book of Moses called Genesis. </p></div>
