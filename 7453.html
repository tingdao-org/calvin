<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他将一对牛切成块子，托付使者传送以色列的全境，说，凡不出来跟随扫罗和撒母耳的，也必这样切开他的牛。于是耶和华使百姓惧怕，他们就都出来，如同一人。</div></div>
