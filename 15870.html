<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为他向我们大施慈爱。耶和华的诚实存到永远。你们要赞美耶和华。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The<em>truth </em>of God, in this passage, is properly introduced as an attestation of his grace. For he can be true even when he menaces the whole world with perdition and ruin. The prophet, however, has placed his <em>mercy </em>first in order that his faithfulness and truth, comprising an assurance of his paternal kindness, might encourage the hearts of the godly. His power and justice are equally praiseworthy; but as men will never cordially praise God until they are drawn by a foretaste of his goodness, the prophet very justly selects God’s mercy and truth, which alone open the mouths of those who are mute to engage in this exercise. When his truth is said to be <em>everlasting, </em>it is not set in opposition to his mercy, as if it, after flourishing for a season, then instantly passed away. The same reason would go to prove, that it was small compared with his mercy, which is said to be abundant. The meaning is, that God’s mercy is rich towards us, flowing in a perennial stream, because united to his eternal truth. If we read, <em>his mercy is confirmed, </em>all difficulty will be removed, for then both constancy and stability will alike adorn his mercy and his truth. </p></div>
