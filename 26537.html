<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus is dead. </em>The goodness of Christ was astonishing, in being able to bear with such gross ignorance in the disciples. And indeed the reason why he delayed, for a time, to bestow upon them the grace of the Spirit in larger measure, was, that the miracle of renewing them in a moment might be the greater. </p></div>
