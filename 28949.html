<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他固然是听了我的劝。但自己更是热心，情愿往你们那里去。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>His receiving the exhortation </em>means that he had undertaken this business, <span class="cite-ref">(687)</span> from being exhorted to it by Paul. He afterwards corrects this by saying, that Titus had not been so much influenced by the advice of others, as he had felt stirred up of his own accord, in accordance with his active disposition. </p><p><strong>(687)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que Tite auoit receu ceste charge</span>;” — “That Titus had received this charge.” </p></div>
