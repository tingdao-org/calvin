<div class="CUV verse">眼不能对手说，我用不着你。头也不能对脚说，我用不着你。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And the eye cannot say to the hand </em>Hitherto he has been showing, what is the office of the less honorable members — to discharge their duty to the body, and not envy the more distinguished members. <em>Now, </em>on the other hand, he enjoins it upon the more honorable members, not to despise the inferior members, which they cannot dispense with. The <em>eye </em>excels the <em>hand, </em>and yet cannot despise it, or insult over it, as though it were useless; and he draws an argument from utility, to show that it ought to be thus — “Those members, that are less esteemed, are the more necessary: hence, with a view to the safety of the body, they must not be despised.” He makes use of the term <em>weaker </em>here, to mean <em>despised, </em>as in another passage, when he says that he <em>glories in his infirmities, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_12:9</span>,) he expresses, under this term, those things which rendered him contemptible and abject. </p></div>
