<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">不肯顺从，也不记念你在他们中间所行的奇事，竟硬着颈项，居心背逆，自立首领，要回他们为奴之地。但你是乐意饶恕人，有恩典，有怜悯，不轻易发怒，有丰盛慈爱的神，并不丢弃他们。</div></div>
