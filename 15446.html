<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为耶和华必不丢弃他的百姓，也不离弃他的产业。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14</strong><em>Surely Jehovah will not cast off his people </em>He enforces the same truth which he had stated above in still clearer terms, denying it to be possible that God should cast off his people, whom he had chosen in a manner to be his inheritance. When assailed by afflictions, we should fly to this consideration, as a sanctuary of refuge, that we are God’s people, gratuitously adopted into his family, and that he must necessarily have a most intimate and tender regard for our safety, having promised to watch as carefully over his Church as if it were his own heritage. We are thus again taught that our patience will soon give way and fail, unless the tumult of carnal suggestions be allayed by a knowledge of the Divine favor shining in upon our souls. </p></div>
