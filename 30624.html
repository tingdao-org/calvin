<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">爱神的，也当爱弟兄，这是我们从神所受的命令。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>And this commandment </em>This is a stronger argument, drawn from the authority and doctrine of Christ; for he not only gave a commandment respecting the love of God, but bade us also to love our brethren. We must therefore so begin with God, as that there may be at the same time a transition made to men. </p></div>
