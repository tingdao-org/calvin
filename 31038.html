<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那兽被擒拿，那在兽面前曾行奇事，迷惑受兽印记，和拜兽像之人的假先知，也与兽同被擒拿。他们两个就活活地被扔在烧着硫磺的火湖里。</div></div>
