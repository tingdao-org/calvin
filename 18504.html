<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们中间谁肯侧耳听此，谁肯留心而听，以防将来呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Who is there among you? </em>Isaiah continues the same subject; for he means that the Jews are and will be so stupid, that they will not see, even when they are warned; and he expressly addresses them, because, while they ought to have been better educated and taught than others, yet they understood nothing, and did not observe the judgments of God, even though they were exceedingly manifest. </p><p><em>Who shall hearken for the time to come? </em>That is, who, being at length subdued by afflictions, repents, though it be late. We see, then, how this astonishment aggravates the criminality of their madness, because they will always refuse to be taught. Yet let us learn what is the use of threatenings and punishments; for God does not reprove our crimes, or punish us for them, as if he delighted in taking vengeance, or demanded some recompense, but that we may be on our guard “for the time to come.” </p></div>
