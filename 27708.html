<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>I persecuted this way. </em>This is the second point, that he was an enemy to Christ’s doctrine, and that he was more fervent in resisting the same than all the rest, until he was pulled back by the hand of God; which thing he saith the chief priests and elders can testify. Therefore, there can be no suspicion in such a sudden change. Whereas he saith, that he had letters given him to deliver to the brethren, it must be referred unto the Jews, as if he had called them his countrymen; but he meant to appease them with a more honorable title. For this is Paul’s drift, that he may declare his natural and lawful beginning which he took of that nation;<span class="cite-ref">(501)</span> and also how desirous he was to be linked with them in friendship. </p><p><strong>(501)</strong></p><p>“ Ab ilia genta... originem,” origin from that nation. </p></div>
