<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">只是你们要谨慎，恐怕你们这自由，竟成了那软弱人的绊脚石。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Take heed that your liberty </em>He leaves their liberty untouched, but moderates the use of it thus far — that it may not give occasion of stumbling to the weak. And he expressly desires that regard be had to the weak, that is, to those who are not, yet thoroughly confirmed in the doctrine of piety, for as they are wont to be regarded with contempt, it is the will and command of the Lord, that regard should be had to them. In the meantime, he hints that strong giants, who may be desirous tyrannically to subject our liberty to their humor, may safely be let alone, <span class="cite-ref">(470)</span> because we need not fear giving offense to those who are not drawn into sin through infirmity, but eagerly catch at something to find fault with. What he means by <em>an occasion, of stumbling </em>we shall see herelong. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(470)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nous ne nous en devons point soucier, mais les laisser la</span>;” — “We should not concern ourselves as to them, but leave them there.” </p></div></div>
