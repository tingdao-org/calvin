<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若为作基督徒受苦，却不要羞耻。倒要因这名归荣耀给神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>Yet if any man suffer as a Christian </em>After having forbidden the Christians to do any hurt or harm, lest for their evil deeds, like the unbelieving, they should become hateful to the world, he now bids them to give thanks to God, if they suffered persecutions for the name of Christ. And truly it is no common kindness from God, that he calls us, freed and exempted from the common punishment of our sins, to so honorable a warfare as to undergo for the testimony of his Gospel either exiles, or prisons, or reproaches, or even death itself. Then he intimates that those are ungrateful to God, who clamor or murmur on account of persecutions, as though they were unworthily dealt with, since on the contrary they ought to regard it as gain and to acknowledge God’s favor. </p><p>But when he says, <em>as a Christian, </em>he regards not so much the name as the cause. It is certain that the adversaries of Christ omitted nothing in order to degrade the Gospel. Therefore, whatever reproachful words they made use of, it was enough for the faithful, that they suffered for nothing else but for the defense of the Gospel. </p><p><em>On this behalf, </em>or, <em>In this respect</em>. For since all afflictions derive their origin from sin, this thought ought to occur to the godly, “I am indeed worthy to be visited by the Lord with this and even with greater punishment for my sins; but now he would have me to suffer for righteousness, as though I were innocent.” For how much soever the saints may acknowledge their own faults, yet as in persecutions they regard a different end, such as the Lord sets before them, they feel that their guilt is blotted out and abolished before God. <em>On this behalf</em>, then, they have reason to glorify God. </p></div>
