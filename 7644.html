<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列人彼此说，这上来的人你看见了吗？他上来是要向以色列人骂阵。若有能杀他的，王必赏赐他大财，将自己的女儿给他为妻，并在以色列人中免他父家纳粮当差。</div></div>
