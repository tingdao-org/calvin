<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Terrible things which we did not look for. </em>He says that the Israelites saw what they did not at all expect; for, although God had forewarned them, and had given them experience of his power in many ways, yet that alarming spectacle of which he speaks goes far beyond our senses and the capacity of the human mind. </p></div>
