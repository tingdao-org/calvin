<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>To the Church of the Thessalonians which is in God</em>. As to the form of salutation, it were superfluous to speak. This only it is necessary to notice — that by a <em>Church in God and Christ </em>is meant one that has not merely been gathered together under the banner of faith, for the purpose of worshipping one God the Father, and confiding in Christ, but is the work and building as well of the Father as of Christ, because while God adopts us to himself, and regenerates us, we from him begin to be in Christ. (<span class="bvs">1Co_1:30</span>) </p></div>
