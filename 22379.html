<div class="comment-content"><p><em>I will therefore kindle a fire in the wall of </em><span class="lang he-il">רבה</span><em>, Rabe, which shall devour its palaces, </em>(the Prophet adds nothing new, I shall therefore go on,) <em>and this by tumult, </em>or <em>by clamour, in the day of war. </em>The Prophet means that enemies would come and suddenly lay waste the kingdom of Ammon; and that this would be the case, as a sudden fire lays hold on wood, in the day of war; that is as soon as the enemy attacked them, it would immediately put them to fight, and execute the vengeance they deserved, <em>by a whirlwind in the day of tempest </em>By these figurative terms the Prophet intimates that the calamity destructive to the Ammonites, would be sudden. </p></div>
