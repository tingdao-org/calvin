<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>But now God hath placed. </em>Here we have another argument, taken from the appointment of God. “It has pleased God, that the body should consist of various members, and that the members should be endowed with various offices and gifts. That member, therefore, which will not rest satisfied with its own station, will wage war with God after the manner of the giants. <span class="cite-ref">(756)</span> Let us, therefore, be subject to the arrangement which God has appointed, that we may not, to no purpose, resist his will.” <span class="cite-ref">(757)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(756)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme les poetes ont dit anciennement des geans</span>;” — “As the poets have told of the giants in ancient times.” The fabled war of the giants with the gods is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, 7, 59, 206; 10, 120. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(757)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De peur de perdre temps, and nous gaster en resistant a la volonte</span>;” — “Lest we should lose time, and do hurt to ourselves by resisting his will.” </p></div></div>
