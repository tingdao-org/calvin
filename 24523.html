<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们来到伯赛大，有人带一个瞎子来，求耶稣摸他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This miracle, which is omitted by the other two Evangelists, appears to have been related by Mark chiefly on account of this circumstance, that Christ <em>restored </em>sight to <em>the blind man</em>, not in an instant, as he was generally accustomed to do, but in a gradual manner. He did so most probably for the purpose of proving, in the case of this man, that he had full liberty as to his method of proceeding, and was not restricted to a fixed rule, so as not to resort to a variety of methods in exercising his power. On this account, he does not all at once enlighten the eyes of <em>the blind man</em>, and fit them for performing their office, but communicates to them at first a dark and confused perception, and afterwards, by laying on his hands a second time, enables them to see perfectly. And so the grace of Christ, which had formerly been poured out suddenly on others, flowed by drops, as it were, on this man. </p></div>
