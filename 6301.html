<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">利未人在你们中间没有分，因为供耶和华祭司的职任就是他们的产业。迦得支派，流便支派，和玛拿西半支派已经在约旦河东得了地业，就是耶和华仆人摩西所给他们的。</div></div>
