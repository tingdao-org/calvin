<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">基哈西告诉王以利沙如何使死人复活，恰巧以利沙所救活，她儿子的那妇人为自己的房屋田地来哀告王。基哈西说，我主我王，这就是那妇人，这是她的儿子，就是以利沙所救活的。</div></div>
