<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我喜爱你的话，好像人得了许多掳物。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>162.</strong><em>I have rejoiced at thy word as one who hath found great spoil </em>No gain, it is well known, brings greater joy than that which conquerors acquire from the spoil of their enemies; for to the gain there is added the glory of triumph; and when profit comes on a sudden, the delight experienced is from that circumstance the greater. This is the reason why David compares the knowledge he had obtained of heavenly doctrine with spoils rather than with other riches; for by these words he intimates that his greatest joy was derived from the word of God, to which no gain however desirable could at all approach. From this was learn that he was contented with the word of God as a thing in which was all his delight, and in which he found solid felicity; which could not be, but, in the way of his first withdrawing his heart from all depraved desires. Nor is it wonderful to find David placing the whole sum of a happy life in the word of God, in which he well knew the treasure of eternal life to be included and offered to him by means of free adoption. </p></div>
