<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">其内必永无人烟，世世代代无人居住。亚拉伯人也不在那里支搭帐棚。牧羊的人，也不使羊群卧在那里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>It shall never be inhabited any more. </em>By the verb <span class="lang he-il">תשב</span>, (<em>thesheb</em>,) <em>shall sit</em>, he means continuance; as if he had said, “There is no hope of restoring Babylon.” All these forms of expression have precisely the same object, that the Babylonians will be destroyed with such a destruction that their ruin shall be perpetual. The picture is still further heightened by adding, that the desolation will be so great that <em>in that place neither will the Arabians pitch their tents, nor the shepherds their folds </em>That place must have been marvellously forsaken and uncultivated, when it was disregarded by those roving tribes; for the <em>Arabians </em>were a wandering and unsettled nation, and had no fixed abode. Having left their native country, because it was barren, and is therefore called Arabia <em>Deserta</em>, (for it is of that country that we speak,) they devoted themselves to feeding flocks and to hunting, and wandered without any fixed residence; for which reason also the Greeks called them <span class="lang el-gr">σκηνήται</span>, (<em>skenetai</em>,) <em>dwellers in tents</em>. Now the country around Babylon was exceedingly fertile before that calamity, which rendered this change the more astonishing and almost miraculous, either because the place lost its former fertility, or because the constant slaughter made all men abhor the sight of it. Undoubtedly the Prophet means that not only will the buildings be thrown down, but the very soil will be accursed. </p></div>
