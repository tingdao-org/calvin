<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">弟兄们，我略略写信给你们，望你们听我劝勉的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And I beseech you, etc. </em>Some understand this as though he was soliciting them to hear him; but I take another view; for he mentions, as I think, that he had written in a <em>few words, </em>or briefly, in order that he might not appear as though he wished to lessen in any degree the ordinary practice of teaching. Let us hence learn that the Scripture has not been committed to us in order to silence the voice of pastors, and that we are not to be fastidious when the same exhortations often sound in our ears; for the holy Spirit has so regulated the writings which he has dictated to the Prophets and the Apostles, that he detracts nothing from the order instituted by himself; and the order is, that constant exhortations should be heard in the Church from the mouth of pastors. And probably he recommends the <em>word of exhortation </em>for this reason, that though men are by nature anxious to learn, they yet prefer to hear something new rather than to be reminded of things known and often heard before. Besides, as they indulge themselves in sloth, they can ill bear to be stimulated and reproved. </p></div>
