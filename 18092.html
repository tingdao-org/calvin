<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish. </em>He repeats what he formerly said; for the Cilicians, on account of their vicinity, constantly traded with the inhabitants of Tyre. He bids their ships <em>howl</em>, because, when that harbour is shut up, the merchants will be struck with amazement at not having their ordinary intercourse. He calls that harbour which they visited, <em>their strength</em>, not only because it was a place of resort that might be relied on, but because there was no other way in which their voyages could yield profit. </p></div>
