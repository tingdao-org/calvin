<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">两个人到了，就为他们祷告，要叫他们受圣灵。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>They prayed</em>. Undoubtedly they taught first, for we know that they were no dumb persons; but Luke passeth over that which was common to them and Philip, and declareth only what new thing the Samaritans had by their coming, to wit, that they had the Spirit given them then. </p></div>
