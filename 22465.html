<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华，万军之神说，以色列家阿，我必兴起一国攻击你们。他们必欺压你们，从哈马口直到亚拉巴的河。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>At last follows a denunciation, and this is the close of the chapter. God then after having seriously exposed the vices which prevailed among the people of Israel, again declares that vengeance of which he had shortly before reminded then; but with this difference only — that God now points out the kind of punishment which he would inflict on the Israelites. He had said before, ‘Behold God commands;’ and then he had spoken of calamity, but expressed not whence that calamity would come: but he now points it out in a special manner, <em>Behold </em>he says <em>I am raising up against you, O house of Israel, a nation, who will straiten you from the entrance into Hemath to the river, etc. </em>The Prophet no doubt speaks here of the Assyrians, and expresses in strong terms how dreadful the war with the Assyrians would be, which was now nigh at hand; for though large was their land and country, (and being large and spacious it had many outlets,) yet the Prophet shows that there would be everywhere straits, when the Lord would raise up on high that nation <em>I am </em>then <em>stirring up a nation against you. </em></p><p>He again calls the Lord, the God of hosts, for the same reason as before, — that they might understand that all the Assyrians were at God’s disposal, and that they would stir up war whenever he gave them a signal. <em>The Lord </em>then <em>will raise up a nation, who will straiten you </em>In what place? He speaks not here of strait places, but of a spacious country, which, as it has been stated, had many outlets. But after the Lord had armed against them the Assyrians, all the most spacious places were made strait to them, “Ye shall be everywhere confined, so that there will be open no escape from death.” </p></div>
