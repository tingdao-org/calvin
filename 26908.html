<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Bring some of the fishes which you have now caught. </em>Though the net was filled in a moment, without any great labor on their part yet the taking of them is not ascribed by Christ to the disciples, thus, we call the bread which we daily eat, OUR <em>bread, </em>and yet, by asking that it may be <em>given </em>to us, we acknowledge that it proceeds from the blessing of God, (<span class="bvs">Mat_6:11</span>.) </p></div>
