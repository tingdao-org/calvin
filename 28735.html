<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Ye are yet in your sins </em>For although Christ by his death atoned for our sins, that they might no more be imputed to us in the judgment of God, and has </p><p>crucified our old man, that its lusts might no longer reign in us, (<span class="bvs">Rom_6:6</span>;) </p><p>and, in fine, has </p><p>by death destroyed the power of death, and the devil himself, (<span class="bvs">Heb_2:14</span>;) </p><p>yet there would have been none of all these things, if he had not, by rising again, come off victorious. Hence, if the resurrection is overthrown, the dominion of sin is set up anew. </p></div>
