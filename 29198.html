<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以有了机会，就当向众人行善。向信徒一家的人更当这样。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>While we have opportunity. </em>The metaphor is still pursued. Every season is not adapted to tillage and sowing. Active and prudent husbandmen will observe the proper season, and will not indolently allow it to pass unimproved. Since, therefore, God has set apart the whole of the present life for ploughing and sowing, let us avail ourselves of the season, lest, through our negligence, it may be taken out of our power. Beginning with liberality to ministers of the gospel, Paul now makes a wider application of his doctrine, and exhorts us to <em>do good to all men</em>, but recommends to our particular regard <em>the household of faith</em>, or believers, because they belong to the same family with ourselves. This similitude is intended to excite us to that kind of communication which ought to be maintained among the members of one family. There are duties which we owe to all men arising out of a common nature; but the tie of a more sacred relationship, established by God himself, binds us to believers. </p></div>
