<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">就夺了底璧和属底璧的城邑，又擒获底璧的王，用刀将这些城中的人口尽行杀灭，没有留下一个。他待底璧和底璧王，像从前待希伯仑和立拿与立拿王一样。</div></div>
