<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">不但这样，并且在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边，是不能的，要从那边过到我们这边，也是不能的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>A vast gulf lieth. </em>These words describe the permanency of the future state, and denote, that the boundaries which separate the reprobate from the elect can never be broken through. And thus we are reminded to return early to the path, while there is yet time, lest we rush headlong into that abyss, from which it will be impossible to rise. The words must not be strictly interpreted, when it is said, that no one is permitted to pass who would wish to descend from heaven to hell; for it is certain, that none of the righteous entertain any such desire. </p></div>
