<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们要切切地求那更大的恩赐，我现今把最妙的道指示你们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Seek after the more excellent gifts. </em>It might also be rendered — <em>Value highly</em>; and it would not suit in with the passage, though it makes little difference as to the meaning; for Paul exhorts the Corinthians to esteem and desire those gifts especially, which are most conducive to edification. For this fault prevailed among them — that they aimed at show, rather than usefulness. Hence prophecy was neglected, while languages sounded forth among them, with great show, indeed, but with little profit. He does not, however, address individuals, as though he wished that every one should aspire at prophecy, or the office of teacher; but simply recommends to them a desire to promote edification, that they may apply themselves the more diligently to those things that are most conducive to edification. </p></div>
