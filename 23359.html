<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣对百夫长说，你回去吧。照你的信心，给你成全了。那时，他的仆人就好了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Go away, and as thou believest, so may it be to thee </em>Hence it is evident how graciously Christ pours out his grace, when he finds the vessel of faith open. Though he addresses these words to the centurion, there can be no doubt that, in his person, he invites us all to strong hope. Hence we are also taught the reason why God is, for the most part, so limited in his communications to us: it is because our unbelief does not permit him to be liberal. If we open up the entrance to him by faith, he will listen to our wishes and prayers. </p></div>
