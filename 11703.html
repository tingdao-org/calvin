<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚兰人离开约阿施的时候，他患重病。臣仆背叛他，要报祭司耶何耶大儿子流血之仇，杀他在床上，葬他在大卫城，只是不葬在列王的坟墓里。</div></div>
