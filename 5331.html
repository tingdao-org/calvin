<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>For the poor shall never cease out of the land</em>. The notion <span class="cite-ref">(147)</span> of those is far fetched who suppose that there would be always poor men among them, because they would not keep the law, and consequently the land would be barren on account of their unrighteousness. I admit that this is true; but God does not here ascribe it to their sins that there would always be some beggars among them, but only reminds them that there would never be wanting matter for their generosity, because He would prove what was in their hearts by setting the poor before them. For, (as I have observed above,) this is why the rich and poor meet together, and the Lord is maker of them all; because otherwise the duties of charity would not be observed unless they put them into exercise by assisting each other. Wherefore God, to stir up the inactivity of the rich, declares that lie prescribes nothing but what continual necessity will require. </p><p><strong>(147)</strong> “I know that ye will not obey me with a perfect heart, and therefore my blessing shall be lessened towards you, and there shall <em>be </em>poor among you.” Hebrew commentators quoted in Munster and Fagius. — Poole’s Syn. </p></div>
