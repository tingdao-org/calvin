<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又要嘱咐他们行善，在好事上富足，甘心施舍，乐意供给人，（供给或作体贴）</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong><em>To do good </em>He adds another remedy to the former, for correcting the sinful dispositions of rich men, by stating authoritatively what is the lawful use of riches; for the richer any man is, the more abundant are his means of doing good to others; and because we are always more tardy than we ought to be in giving to the poor, he employs many words in commendation of that virtue. </p></div>
