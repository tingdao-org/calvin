<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>57.</strong><em>Crying with a loud voice. </em>This was either a vain show of zeal, as hypocrites are almost always pricked forward with ambition to break out into immoderate heat; as Caiaphas when he heard Christ say thus, After this ye shall see the Son of man, etc., did rent his clothes in token of indignation, as if it were intolerable blasphemy; or else certainly the preaching of the glory of Christ was unto them such a torment, that they must needs burst through madness. And I am rather of this mind; for Luke saith afterward, that they were carried violently, as those men which have no hold of themselves use to leap out immoderately. <span class="cite-ref">(479)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(479)</span> “Subito et intemperanter prosilire,” break out suddenly and intemperately. </p></div></div>
