<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们曾说，我们必能以舌头得胜。我们的嘴唇是我们自己的。谁能作我们的主呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This the Psalmist confirms more fully in the following verse: <em>Who have said, we will be strengthened by our tongues </em>Those must be possessed of great authority who think that, in the very falsehood to which they are addicted, they have enough of strength to accomplish their purposes, and to protect themselves. It is the utmost height of wickedness for persons to break out into such presumption, that they scruple not to overthrow all law and equity by their arrogant and boasting language; for, in doing this, it is just as if they openly declared war against God himself. Some read, <em>we will strengthen our tongues. </em>This reading is passable, in so far as the sense is concerned, but it scarcely agrees with the rules of grammar, because the letter <span class="lang he-il">ל</span>, <em>lamed, </em>is added. Moreover, the sense which is more suitable is this: that the wicked persons spoken of being armed with their tongues, go beyond all bounds, and think they can accomplish by this means whatever they please; just as this set of men so deform every thing with their calumnies, that they would almost cover the sun himself with darkness. </p></div>
