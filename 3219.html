<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他进圣所赎罪的时候，会幕里不可有人，直等到他为自己和本家并以色列全会众赎了罪出来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And there shall be no man. </em>The driving away of all men from approaching the tabernacle during the act of atonement is a sort of punishment by temporary banishment, that they may perceive themselves to be driven from God’s face, whilst the place is purified which had been defiled by their sins. This was a melancholy sight, when all these for whose sake it was erected were obliged to desert it; but in this way they were reminded that every part and particle of our salvation depends on God’s mercy only, when they saw themselves excluded from the remedy designed for obtaining pardon, unless a new pardon should come to their aid, since they had fallen away from the hope of reconciliation. </p></div>
