<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">每早晨，这都是新的。你的诚实极其广大。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This verse confirms what I have said, that the same truth is here repeated by the Prophet, that God’s mercies were not consumed, nor had his compassion’s failed. How so? Because they were new, or renewed, every day; but he puts <em>morning</em>, and that in the plural number. I am surprised at the hour striking so soon; I hardly think that I have lectured a whole hour. </p></div>
