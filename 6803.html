<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚比米勒和跟随他的人就都上撒们山。亚比米勒手拿斧子，砍下一根树枝，扛在肩上，对跟随他的人说，你们看我所行的，也当赶紧照样行。</div></div>
