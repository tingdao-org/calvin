<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚伯拉罕的仆人听见他们这话，就向耶和华俯伏在地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>52.</strong><em>He worshipped</em>. Moses again repeats that Abraham’s servant gave thanks to God; and it is not without reason that he so often inculcates this religious duty; because, since God requires nothing greater from us, the neglect of it betrays the most shameful indolence. The acknowledgment of God’s kindness is a sacrifice of sweet-smelling savor; yea, it is a more acceptable service than all sacrifices. God is continually heaping innumerable benefits upon men. Their ingratitude, therefore, is intolerable, if they fail to exercise themselves in celebrating those benefits. </p></div>
