<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以你们要完全，象你们的天父完全一样。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>You shall therefore be perfect. </em>This <em>perfection </em>does not mean <em>equality, </em>but relates solely to resemblance. <span class="cite-ref">(423)</span> However distant we are from the perfection of God, we are said to be <em>perfect, as he is perfect, </em>when we aim at the same object, which he presents to us in Himself. Should it be thought preferable, we may state it thus. There is no comparison here made between God and us: but the <em>perfection </em>of God means, <em>first, </em>that free and pure kindness, which is not induced by the expectation of gain; — and, <em>secondly, </em>that remarkable goodness, which contends with the malice and ingratitude of men. This appears more clearly from the words of Luke, <em>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful: </em>for <em>mercy </em>is contrasted with a mercenary regard, which is founded on private advantage. </p><p><strong>(423)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceste perfection ne signifie pas qu'il y ait une.equalite et mesme mesure, mais elle se rapporte seulement a quelque ressemblance ou ap-proche</span>.” — “That perfection does not mean that there is an equality or thee same measure, but it relates solely to some resemblance or approach.” </p></div>
