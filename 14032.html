<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，认识你名的人要倚靠你。因你没有离弃寻求你的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>In the tenth verse, the Psalmist teaches us, that when the Lord delivers the righteous, the fruit which results from it is, that they themselves, and all the rest of the righteous, acquire increasing confidence in his grace; for, unless we are fully persuaded that God exercises a care about men and human affairs, we must necessarily be troubled with constant disquietude. But as most men shut their eyes that they may not see the judgments of God, David restricts this advantage to the faithful alone, and, certainly, where there is no godliness, there is no sense of the works of God. It is also to be observed, that he attributes to the faithful <em>the knowledge of God; </em>because from this religion proceeds, whereas it is extinguished through the ignorance and stupidity of men. Many take the <em>name of God </em>simply for God himself; but, as I have observed in my remarks on a preceding psalm, I think something more is expressed by this term. As God’s essence is hidden and incomprehensible, his name just means his character, so far as he has been pleased to make it known to us. David next explains the ground of this trust in God to be, that he <em>does not forsake those who seek him </em>God is sought in two ways, either by invocation and prayers, or by studying to live a holy and an upright life; and, indeed, the one is always inseparably joined with the other. But as the Psalmist is here treating of the protection of God, on which the safety of the godly depends, <em>to seek God, </em>as I understand it, is to betake ourselves to him for help and relief in danger and distress. </p></div>
