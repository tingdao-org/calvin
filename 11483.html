<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他对犹大人说，我们要建造这些城邑，四围筑墙，盖楼，安门，作闩。地还属我们，是因寻求耶和华我们的神。我们既寻求他，他就赐我们四境平安。于是建造城邑，诸事亨通。</div></div>
