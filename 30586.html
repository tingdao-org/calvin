<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>He that doeth righteousness </em>The Apostle shews here that newness of life is testified by good works; nor does that likeness of which he has spoken, that is between Christ and his members, appear, except by the fruits they bring forth; as though he had said, “Since it behooves us to be conformed to Christ, the truth and evidence of this must appear in our life.” The exhortation is the same with that of Paul in Galatians </p><p>“If ye live in the Spirit, walk also in the Spirit.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Gal_5:25</span>) </p><p>For many would gladly persuade themselves that they have this righteousness buried in their hearts, while iniquity evidently occupies their feet, and hands, and tongue, and eyes. </p></div>
