<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们就去见大祭司希勒家，将奉到神殿的银子交给他。这银子是看守殿门的利未人从玛拿西，以法莲，和一切以色列剩下的人，以及犹大，便雅悯众人，并耶路撒冷的居民收来的。</div></div>
