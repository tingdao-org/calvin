<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>My time is not yet come. </em>There are some who erroneously interpret this as referring to the <em>time </em>of his death, for it denotes the <em>time </em>of his setting out on the journey to go to the feast. <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span> He assures them that, in this respect, he differs from his relations. They may freely and without danger appear, at all hours, before the world, because the world is friendly and favorable to them; but he is in dread of his person, and justly, because the world is his mortal enemy. By these words he means that they do wrong in giving advice on a matter which they do not understand. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(181)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De se mettre en chemin pour aller a la feste</span>.” </p></div></div>
