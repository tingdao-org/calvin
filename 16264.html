<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">看在我里面有什么恶行没有，引导我走永生的道路。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>And lead me, </em>etc. I see no foundation for the opinion of some that this is an imprecation, and that David adjudges himself over to punishment. It is true, that “the way of all the earth” is an expression used sometimes to denote death, which is common to all, but the verb here translated to <em>lead </em>is more commonly taken in a good than a bad sense, and I question if the phrase <em>way of this life </em>ever means death. <span class="cite-ref">(221)</span> It seems evidently to denote the full continuous term of human life, and David prays God to guide him even to the end of his course. I am aware some understand it to refer to eternal life, nor is it denied that the world to come is comprehended under the full term of life to which the Psalm~ ist alludes, but it seems enough to hold by the plain sense of the words, That God would watch over his servant to whom he had already shown kindness to the end, and not forsake him in the midst of his days. </p><p><strong>(221)</strong> On the margin of the French Commentary Calvin refers to <span class="bvs">Jos_23:14</span>. </p></div>
