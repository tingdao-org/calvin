<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Martha having heard that Jesus was coming. Martha </em>travels beyond the village, as we shall afterwards see, not only perhaps on account of the reverence which she bore to Christ, but that she might meet him more secretly; for his danger was fresh in his recollection, and the rage of enemies had not well subsided, which had been a little abated by Christ’s departure into Galilee, but might, on their hearing of his arrival, break out anew with greater violence. </p></div>
