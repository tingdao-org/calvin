<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人给她和她的群众在被杀的人中设立床榻。她民的坟墓在她四围，他们都是未受割礼被刀杀的。他们曾在活人之地使人惊恐，并且与下坑的人一同担当羞辱。以拦已经放在被杀的人中。</div></div>
