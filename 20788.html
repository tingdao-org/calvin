<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你在一切市口上建造高台，使你的美貌变为可憎的，又与一切过路的多行淫乱。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He now adds, <em>that he made their beauty to be abhorred. </em>I have no doubt that the Prophet alludes to the filthiness of abandoned women; and even the Latins called them “worn out,” whose foulness arises from their utterly giving themselves up to every wickedness. The Prophet then says that the people were not only like an abandoned woman who engages in impure amours, but that their conduct was gross in the extreme; for though many gratify improper desires through intemperate lust, yet they fastidiously reject those foul and shameless females who are notorious for profligacy. The Prophet means, then, that the people had come to such a pitch of abomination, just as the most abandoned of the sex. He now adds, <em>you have spread thy feet to every passer-by, and have multiplied thy fornications. </em>This is taken also from the conduct of harlots and confirms what we have already explained, that the Jews indulged not only in one kind of idolatry, but were prone to all abominations, like females who beset the paths, and address all they meet, and not only so, but shamelessly <em>spread their feet </em>everywhere to entice admirers. </p></div>
