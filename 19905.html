<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">主我的王阿，这些人向先知耶利米一味地行恶，将他下在牢狱中。他在那里必因饥饿而死，因为城中再没有粮食。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He then said, that the king’s counselors had <em>done wickedly in all the things which they had done against Jeremiah the Prophet, </em>because they had cast him into the well: and he added, <em>There he will die under himself, </em>or as some render it, and rightly, <em>“in </em>his own place.” But the expression is striking, but cannot be fully expressed in our language: for Ebedmelech meant that Jeremiah would die, though no one molested him, though no evil or harm were done to him by another. <em>He will, </em>then, <em>die in his own place, </em>that is, he will die, if left where he is; because he lay, as it has appeared, sunk in mire. And then he said, <em>He will die through famine; </em>for he had been cast into the pit as into a grave. And as scarcity prevailed among the whole people, Jeremiah could not have hoped for any aid; and bread, as we shall hereafter see, could not have been thrown to him. Then Ebedmelech says here first, that Jeremiah had been unworthily treated, because he was <em>God’s Prophet; </em>for he honors him with this title, that he might expose the impiety of the princes; and secondly, he shews how miserably he lay in the pit, because no one could supply him with food, and there was no more bread in the city. It now follows — </p></div>
