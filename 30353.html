<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">现今你们竟以张狂夸口。凡这样夸口都是恶的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>But now ye rejoice</em>, or, <em>glory</em>. We may learn from these words that James condemned something more than a passing speech.<em>Ye rejoice</em>, or, <em>glory</em>, he says, in your empty boastings. Though they robbed God of his government, they yet flattered themselves; not that they openly set themselves up as superior to God, though they were especially inflated with confidence in themselves, but that their minds were inebriated with vanity so as to disregard God. And as warnings of this kind are usually received with contempt by ungodly men — nay, this answer is immediately given, “known to ourselves is what is offered to us, so that there is no need of such a warning;” — he alleges against them this knowledge in which they gloried, and declares that they sinned the more grievously, because they did not sin through ignorance, but through contempt. </p></div>
