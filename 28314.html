<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Praise God, all ye Gentiles, etc. </em>This passage is not inaptly applied; for how can they, who know not God’s greatness, praise him? They could no more do this than to call on his name, when unknown. It is then a prophecy most suitable to prove the calling of the Gentiles; and this appears still more evident from the reason which is there added; for he bids them to give thanks for God’s truth and mercy. (<span class="bvs">Psa_117:1</span>.) </p></div>
