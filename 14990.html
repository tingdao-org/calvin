<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">愿那与我性命为敌的，羞愧被灭。愿那谋害我的，受辱蒙羞。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>While invoking the aid of God, he at the same time prays (verse 13) that his enemies may be filled with shame until they be consumed. These words, however, may not improperly be read in the future tense; for it is frequently the practice of David, after having ended his prayer, to rise up against his enemies, and, as it were, to triumph over them. But I have followed that which seems more agreeable to the scope of the passage. Having had occasion elsewhere to explain this imprecation, it is unnecessary for me to repeat, in this place, what I have previously said. </p></div>
