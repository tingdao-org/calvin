<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以法莲，玛拿西，以萨迦，西布伦有许多人尚未自洁，他们却也吃逾越节的羊羔，不合所记录的定例。希西家为他们祷告说，凡专心寻求神，就是耶和华他列祖之神的，虽不照着圣所洁净之礼自洁，求至善的耶和华也饶恕他。</div></div>
