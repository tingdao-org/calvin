<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并且你们要为我的名，被众人恨恶，惟有忍耐到底的，必然得救。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>But he who endured to the end shall be saved </em>This single promise ought sufficiently to support the minds of the godly, though the whole world should rise against them: for they are assured that the result will be prosperous and happy. If those who fight under earthly commanders, and are uncertain as to the issue of the battle, are carried forward even to death by steadiness of purpose, shall those who are certain of victory hesitate to abide by the cause of Christ to the very last? </p></div>
