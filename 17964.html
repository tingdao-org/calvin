<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们在街市上都腰束麻布，在房顶上和宽阔处，俱各哀号，眼泪汪汪。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>In his streets. </em><span class="cite-ref">(239)</span> He proceeds with the same subject, describing more fully the tokens of mourning, in which the eastern nations abound more than others; for, having quicker understandings and keener feelings, they express their emotions by outward signs more than others do, who, being slower in apprehension, are likewise slower in movement and gesture. It was no doubt faulty in them that they indulged in so many ceremonies and gesticulations; but the Prophet spoke of them as what was known and common, only for the purpose of describing the grief which would follow the desolation of that country. </p><p><em>Every one shall howl and descend to weeping. </em><span class="cite-ref">(240)</span> It was with good reason that he added this description; for we are never moved by predictions, unless the Lord place them, as it were, before our eyes. Lest the Jews should think that these matters might be lightly passed by, when he described that destruction, he determined to mention also <em>mourning, weeping, and howling</em>, that they might see almost with their own eyes those events which appear to be incredible, for the Moabites were at that time in a state of profound peace, and believers had the more need of being confirmed, that they might not call this prophecy in question. By the same means he points out the despair to which unbelievers are liable in adversity, for the support on which they rely is insecure. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(239)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(240)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
