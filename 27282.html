<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">彼得就请他们进去，住了一宿。次日起身和他们同去，还有约帕的几个弟兄同着他去。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong>And Peter also, being overcome with the authority of God, deliberateth no longer, but lodgeth the men, that he may go with them forthwith. So we must meekly submit ourselves to God; and there remaineth nothing after that we know his will, but that we run speedily thither whither he calleth us. There is no difficulty in the rest. </p></div>
