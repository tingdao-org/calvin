<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>As for this man, we know not whence he is. </em>When they say so, they refer not to his country or the place of his birth, but to the prophetical office. For they allege that they have no knowledge of his calling, so as to receive him as having proceeded from God. </p></div>
