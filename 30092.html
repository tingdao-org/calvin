<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">律法本是立软弱的人为大祭司。但在律法以后起誓的话，是立儿子为大祭司，乃是成全到永远的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>For the law, etc. </em>From the defects of men he draws his conclusion as to the weakness of the priesthood, as though he had said, “Since the law makes no real priests, the defect must by some other means be remedied; and it is remedied by the <em>word of the oath; </em>for Christ was made a priest, being not of the common order of men, but the Son of God, subject to no defect, but adorned and endowed with the highest perfection.” He again reminds us, that the <em>oath </em>was posterior to the law, in order to show that God, being not satisfied with the priesthood of the law, designed to constitute a better priesthood; for in the institutions of God what succeeds advances the former to a better state, or it abolishes what was designed to exist only for a time. </p></div>
