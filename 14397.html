<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们要尝尝主恩的滋味，便知道他是美善。投靠他的人有福了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Taste and see that Jehovah is good. </em>In this verse the Psalmist indirectly reproves men for their dulness in not perceiving the goodness of God, which ought to be to them more than matter of simple knowledge. By the word <em>taste </em>he at once shows that they are without taste; and at the same time he assigns the reason of this to be, that they devour the gifts of God without relishing them, or through a vitiated loathing ungratefully conceal them. He, therefore, calls upon them to stir up their senses, and to bring a palate endued with some capacity of tasting, that God’s goodness may become known to them, or rather, be made manifest to them. The words literally rendered are, <em>Taste and see, for the Lord is good; </em>but the particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki</em>, <em>for, </em>is taken exegetically. David’s meaning, therefore, is, that there is nothing on the part of God to prevent the godly, to whom he particularly speaks in this place, from arriving at the knowledge of his goodness by actual experience. From this it follows, that they also are infected with the common malady of dulness. This doctrine is confirmed by the promise immediately added, <em>Blessed is the man who trusteth in him; </em>for God never disappoints the expectations of those who seek his favor. Our own unbelief is the only impediment which prevents him from satisfying us largely and bountifully with abundance of all good things. </p></div>
