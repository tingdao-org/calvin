<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">只是没有孩子，因为以利沙伯不生育，两个人又年纪老迈了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And they had no child </em>By an extraordinary purpose of God it was appointed that John should be born out of the common and ordinary course of nature. The same thing happened with Isaac, (<span class="bvs">Gen_17:17</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_21:1</span>,) in whom God had determined to give an uncommon and remarkable demonstration of his favor. Elisabeth had been barren in the prime of life, and now she is in old age, which of itself shuts up the womb. By two hinderances, therefore, the Lord gives a twofold, surprising exhibition of his power, in order to testify, by stretching out his hand, as it were, from heaven, that the Prophet was sent by himself, (<span class="bvs">Mal_3:1</span>; <span class="bvs">Joh_1:6</span>.) He is indeed a mortal man, born of earthly parents; but a supernatural method, so to speak, recommends him strongly as if he had fallen from heaven </p></div>
