<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>But if Timothy come. </em>He speaks as if he were not as yet certain as to his coming. Now he charges them as to Timothy, so that he may be with them in safety — not as though he were in danger of his life among them, but because he would have enemies of Christ <span class="cite-ref">(166)</span> to oppose him. He wishes, therefore, that they should carefully take heed that no injury be done to him. </p><p>He adds the reason — for he <em>worketh the work of the Lord </em>Hence we infer, that the Church of Christ ought to be concerned for the preservation of the lives of ministers. And assuredly, it is reasonable, that, in proportion as an individual is endowed with superior gifts for the edification of believers, and applies himself to it the more strenuously, his life ought to be so much dearer to us. </p><p>The clause — <em>as I also do, </em>is made use of, either to express his <em>excellence, </em>or simply to point out the similarity as to office, inasmuch as both labored in the word. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(166)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Beaucoup d’ennemis de Christ</span>;” — “Many enemies of Christ.” </p></div></div>
