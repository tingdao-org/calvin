<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣这话是指着加略人西门的儿子犹大说的。他本是十二个门徒里的一个，后来要卖耶稣的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>71.</strong><em>He spoke of Judas </em>Although Judas had a bad conscience, still we do not read that he was at all moved. Hypocrites are so stupid that they do not feel their sores, and in the presence of men they have such hardened effrontery, that they do not scruple to prefer themselves to the very best of men. </p></div>
