<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华就差遣一个使者进入亚述王营中，把所有大能的勇士和官长，将帅尽都灭了。亚述王满面含羞地回到本国，进了他神的庙中，有他亲生的儿子在那里用刀杀了他。</div></div>
