<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以他的差役，若装作仁义的差役，也不算希奇。他们的结局，必然照着他们的行为。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Whose end shall be. </em>He adds this for the consolation of the pious. For it is the statement of a courageous man, who despises the foolish judgments of men, and patiently waits for the day of the Lord. In the mean time, he shows a singular boldness of conscience, which does not dread the judgment of God. </p></div>
