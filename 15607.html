<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">愿罪人从世上消灭。愿恶人归于无有。我的心哪，要称颂耶和华。你们要赞美耶和华。（原文作哈利路亚下同）</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>Let sinners perish from the earth </em>This imprecation depends on the last clause of the 31<span class="cite-ref">st</span> verse, <em>Let Jehovah rejoice in his works </em>As the wicked infect the world with their pollutions, the consequence is, that God has less delight in his own workmanship, and is even almost displeased with it. It is impossible, but that this uncleanness, which, being extended and diffused through every part of the world, vitiates and corrupts such a noble product of his hands, must be offensive to him. Since then the wicked, by their perverse abuse of God’s gifts, cause the world in a manner to degenerate and fall away from its first original, the prophet justly desires that they may be exterminated, until the race of them entirely fail. Let us then take care so to weigh the providence of God, as that being wholly devoted to obeying him, we may rightly and purely use the benefits which he sanctities for our enjoying them. Farther, let us be grieved, that such precious treasures are wickedly squandered away, and let us regard it as monstrous and detestable, that men not only forget their Maker, but also, as it were, purposely turn to a perverse and an unworthy end, whatever good things he has bestowed upon them. </p></div>
