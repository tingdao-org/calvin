<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_20:34</span><strong>.</strong><em>And followed him. </em>This was an expression of gratitude, <span class="cite-ref">(673)</span> when the blind men became <em>followers </em>of Christ; for, though it is uncertain how long they discharged this duty, yet it showed a grateful mind, that they presented themselves to many, in that journey, as mirrors of the grace of Christ. Luke adds, that <em>the people gave praise to God, </em>which tends to prove the certainty of the miracle. </p><p><strong>(673)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceci a este un signe de recognoissance du bien receu de Christ</span>;” — “this was an expression of gratitude for the favor received from Christ.” </p></div>
