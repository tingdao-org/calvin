<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">哈曼对亚哈随鲁王说，有一种民，散居在王国各省的民中，他们的律例与万民的律例不同，也不守王的律例，所以容留他们与王无益。</div></div>
