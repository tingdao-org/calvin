<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">狮子若非抓食，岂能在林中咆哮呢？少壮狮子若无所得，岂能从洞中发声呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The second similitude follows, <em>Will a lion roar in the forest without a prey? Will a lion send forth his voice from his den when he has caught nothing? </em>By this verse he intimates that God does not cry out for nothing by his Prophets; for ungodly men supposed that the air was only made to reverberate by an empty sound, when the Prophets threatened, “These,” they said, “are mere words;” as though indeed they could not find that the necessity of crying arose from themselves, because they had provoked God by their vices. Hence the Prophet, meeting their objection, says, “If lions roar not, except when they have obtained a prey, shall God cry from heaven and send forth his voice as far as the earth, when there is no prey?” The meaning is, that the word of God was very shamefully despised by the Israelites, as though there was no reason for crying, as though God was trifling with them. His word is indeed precious, and is not thrown heedlessly into the air, as if it were a mere refuse; but it is an invaluable seed. Since the Lord cries, it is not, says Amos, without a lawful cause. How so? The lions do not indeed roar without prey; God then does not cry by his Prophets, except for the best reason. It hence follows that the Israelites were hitherto extremely stupid inasmuch as they did not listen with more earnestness and attention to the teaching of the Prophets, as though God had uttered only an empty sound. </p></div>
