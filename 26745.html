<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣看出他们要问他，就说，我说等不多时，你们就不得见我，再等不多时，你们还要见我。你们为这话彼此相问吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Jesus, therefore, knew that they wished to ask him. </em>Though sometimes the Lord appears to speak to the deaf, he, at length, cures the ignorance of his disciples, that his instruction may not be useless. Our duty is to endeavor that our slowness of apprehension may not be accompanied by either pride or indolence, but that, on the contrary, we show ourselves to be humble and desirous to learn. </p></div>
