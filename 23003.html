<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">推罗为自己修筑保障，积蓄银子如尘沙，堆起精金如街上的泥土。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>For Tyrus has for herself built a fortress</em>. The Prophet shows by these words how very cautious or prudent the Syrians had been; for they fortified themselves by strongholds, and thought themselves to be beyond the reach of danger. He then adds, <em>and heaped to herself silver as dust, and gold as the mire of the streets</em>, that is, accumulated wealth above measure; for he mentions “dust” and “mire” as signifying an immense heap; as though he had said, “They have worthless heaps of silver and gold for their vast abundance”. He no doubt includes silver and gold in the fortress which he mentions; for I do not confine the word fortress only to towers and strongholds; but the Prophet, as I think, states generally, that Tyrus was so furnished and fortified with wealth, forces, and all kinds of defences, that it thought itself impregnable. </p><p>There is a striking correspondence between <span class="lang he-il">צור</span>, <em>tsur</em>, and <span class="lang he-il">מצור</span>, <em>metsur </em><span class="lang he-il">צור</span>, <em>Tsur</em>, he says, has built <span class="lang he-il">מצור</span>, <em>metsur</em>, a fortress. It is a paronomasia worthy of notice, but cannot be retained in Latin. </p></div>
