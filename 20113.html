<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">西比玛的葡萄树阿，我为你哀哭，甚于雅谢人哀哭。你的枝子蔓延过海，直长到雅谢海。那行毁灭的已经临到你夏天的果子和你所摘的葡萄。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet shews more clearly what he had said generally before, that Sibmah would weep for her vines, after having wept for Jazer. These were cities in the land of Moab, as it appears from other places. Some give this rendering, “In comparison with the weeping” or mourning, etc.; and <span class="lang he-il">מן</span>, <em>men</em>, as it is well known, has this meaning; but as <span class="lang he-il">ב</span>,<em>beth</em>, “in weeping,” is adopted by Isaiah, instead of <span class="lang he-il">מן</span>, <em>men</em>, there is no doubt but that the Prophet means a continued mourning, when he says, <em>From </em>(or with) <em>the weeping of Jazer I will weep for thee, vine of Sibmah</em>; that is, there will be no end to weeping; for after the Moabites had mourned for the destruction of the city Jazer, a new cause of weeping would arise, for other cities would be destroyed, and especially Sibmah. </p><p>Now the region of Sibmah was very fertile, especially on account of the abundance of vines. Then the Prophet includes the whole wealth of that city under the word <em>vine</em>; nay, he designates the citizens as its shoots or young branches. <em>I will weep</em>, he says, “<em>over thee, the vine </em>of the vine-bearing region of <em>Sibmah</em>; for <em>thy shoots</em>, that is, thy wealth, <em>have passed over the sea</em>, and the citizens of Jazer, who were thy neighbors.” He afterwards repeats respecting the city of Jazer what he had said, because its calamity was connected with the other, and was the same. For God had involved these two cities in the same destruction. <em>Jazer </em>then <em>came even to the sea. </em>Now <em>a waster rushed in</em>: Isaiah has shouting, <span class="lang he-il">הידד</span>, <em>eidad</em>, which is added presently here; but the word there has quite a different meaning, that all rejoicing would cease. The word here is <span class="lang he-il">שדד</span>, <em>shidad</em>, and means a waster or spoiler. <em>A waster </em>then <em>has fallen</em>, that is, has come with great irresistible force, on thy vintages and harvests; that is, that he may scatter and consume all things. It follows, — </p></div>
