<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">就是人蒙神赐他赀财，丰富，尊荣，以致他心里所愿的一样都不缺，只是神使他不能吃用，反有外人来吃用。这是虚空，也是祸患。</div></div>
