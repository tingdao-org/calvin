<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>To turn away the deputy from the faith. </em>No marvel if the seducer seek to put away the light, whereby he saw his own darkness driven away. <span class="cite-ref">(782)</span> The same stour [contest] have we at this day with a number of babblers, who use to sell their smokes, and to shut, by all shifts possible, the eyes of the simple, that they may not behold the Sun of righteousness, being now risen. We must wrestle with such lets; for as there be [not] always and everywhere magicians present, which procure us some business, <span class="cite-ref">(783)</span> Satan thrusteth in lets <span class="cite-ref">(784)</span> enough, which possess our minds to drive away Christ, which the flesh is too ready to receive. Finally, both the enticements of the world and the wicked affections of our flesh are as many charms, whereby Satan ceaseth not to overthrow the faith. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(782)</span> “Discuti,” dispelled. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(783)</span> “Nam ut non semper et ubique praesto sint magi qui negotium nobis facessant,” for though magicians are not always and everywhere present to give us trouble. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(784)</span> “Avocamenta,” enticements. </p></div></div>
