<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">买了窑户的一块田。这是照着主所吩咐我的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>As the Lord appointed me. </em>By this clause Matthew confirms the statement, that this was not done without the providence of God; because, while they have a different object in view, they unconsciously fulfill an ancient prediction. For how could it have occurred to them to <em>purchase a field </em>from <em>a potter, </em>if the Lord had not turned their blameworthy conduct so as to carry into execution his own purpose? </p></div>
