<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old. </em>It is not without reason that the great age of Aaron is expressly stated, inasmuch as his life had been prolonged to an unusual period, for the good of the people. At the age of an hundred he had already exceeded the ordinary extent of life; whereas, by God’s extraordinary blessing, he survived until the people were about to pass into the promised land. Hence their ingratitude was the more base in not acknowledging this paternal <em>care </em>of God, since it was for their advantage that He preserved so long the minister of His grace. </p></div>
