<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">乃因以法莲山地的一个人比基利的儿子示巴举手攻击大卫王，你们若将他一人交出来，我便离城而去。妇人对约押说，那人的首级必从城墙上丢给你。</div></div>
