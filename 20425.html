<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">吃奶孩子的舌头因干渴贴住上膛。孩童求饼，无人掰给他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He says that sucking children were so thirsty, that the tongue was as it were fixed to the palate; and it was a dreadful thing; for mothers would willingly pour forth their own blood to feed their infants. When, therefore, the tongue of a child clave to his mouth, it seemed to be in a manner beyond nature. Among other calamities, then, the Prophet names this, that <em>infants pined away with thirst, </em>and also that <em>children sought bread </em>in vain. He speaks not in the latter instance of sucklings, but. of children three or four years old. Then he says that they <em>sought </em>or asked for bread, but that there was no one to give. <span class="cite-ref">(210)</span></p><p>He describes here the famine of the city, of which he had predicted, when he declared that it would be better with the slain than with the people remaining alive, for a harder conflict with famine and want would await the living. But this was not believed. Now, then, the Prophet upbraids the Jews with their former perverseness. He afterwards adds, — </p><p><strong>(210)</strong> The verbs here are in the past tense, and not in the present, as in our version, — </p><p>Cleave did the tongue of the suckling <LineBreak />To his palate through thirst; <LineBreak />Children asked bread, <LineBreak />A breaker, none <em>was </em>to them. </p><p>— <em>Ed </em></p></div>
