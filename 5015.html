<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你在何烈山站在耶和华你神面前的那日，耶和华对我说，你为我招聚百姓，我要叫他们听见我的话，使他们存活在世的日子，可以学习敬畏我，又可以教训儿女这样行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>The day </em><span class="cite-ref">(227)</span><em>that thou stoodest. </em>The word <em>day </em>might be taken in the accusative, as if in apposition. It is, at any rate, clear that he explains more fully what he had briefly alluded to before, for he summons the people as eye-witnesses, lest, perchance, they should object that they were not sure from whence Moses had derived what he professes to be enjoined him by God. For they were all well aware that he had undertaken nothing without the express command of God. Finally, he proves, from the end and object itself of the doctrine, that God was its author, since it tended to nothing else but that God should be purely served, and that His people might be obedient, than which nothing can be imagined more just and right. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(227)</span> “In the day,” etc. — <em>lat. </em></p></div></div>
