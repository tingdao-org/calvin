<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>And are you also seduced? </em>While they reprove their officers, they endeavor, at the same time, to keep them in subjection. For by these words they mean, that it would be unreasonable and unbecoming that they should not remain steady, though the whole people should revolt. But we must see on what argument they rest, when they so haughtily insult Christ. </p></div>
