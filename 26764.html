<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">父阿，现在求你使我同你享荣耀，就是未有世界以先，我同你所有的荣耀。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>The glory which I had with thee. </em>He desires to be <em>glorified with the Father</em>, not that the Father may <em>glorify </em>him secretly, without any witnesses, but that, having been received into heaven, he may give a magnificent display of his greatness and power, <em>that every knee may bow to him</em>, (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:10</span>.) Consequently, that phrase in the former clause, <em>with the Father</em>, is contrasted with earthly and fading glory, as Paul describes the blessed immortality of Christ, by saying that </p><p>he died to sin once, but now he liveth to God, (<span class="bvs">Rom_6:10</span>.) </p><p><em>The glory which I had with thee before the world was. </em>He now declares that he desires nothing that does not strictly belong to him, but only that he may appear in the flesh, such as he was before the creation of the world; or, to speak more plainly, that the Divine majesty, which he had always possessed, may now be illustriously displayed in the person of the Mediator, and in the human flesh with which he was clothed. This is a remarkable passage, which teaches us that Christ is not a God who has been newly contrived, or who has existed only for a time; for if his <em>glory </em>was eternal, himself also has always been. Besides, a manifest distinction between the person of Christ and the person of the rather is here expressed; from which we infer, that he is not only the eternal God, but also that he is the eternal Word of God, begotten by the rather before all ages. </p></div>
