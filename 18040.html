<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我心慌张，惊恐威吓我，我所羡慕的黄昏，变为我的战兢。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>My heart was shaken. </em>Others render it not amiss, “my heart wandered;” for excessive terror moves the heart, as it were, out of its place. He declares how sudden and unlooked for will be the destruction of Babylon, for a sudden calamity makes us tremble more than one which has been long foreseen and expected. Daniel relates, that what Isaiah here foretells was accomplished, and that he was an eye-witness. Belshazzar had that night prepared a magnificent banquet, when the Persians suddenly rushed upon him, and nothing was farther from his expectation than that he would be slain. High delight was thus suddenly changed into terror. (<span class="bvs">Dan_5:30</span>.) </p></div>
