<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And in his name shall the Gentiles trust </em>Instead of these words the prophet has, <em>The isles shall wait for his law. </em>But though Matthew has changed the words, the meaning is the same, that the grace of Christ will be shared by the Gentiles. </p></div>
