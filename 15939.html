<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我羡慕你的训词。求你使我在你的公义上生活。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>Behold, I have a desire to thy precepts </em>This is a repetition of what he declared a little before, with regard to his pious affection, and his love of righteousness; and that nothing was wanting but God to complete the work which he had commenced. If this interpretation be admitted, then, <em>to be quickened in the righteousness of God, </em>will be tantamount to being quickened in the way. The term <em>righteousness </em>is often put in this psalm for the law of God, or the rule of a righteous life. This view tends to make the two parts of the verse accord with one another. “Lord<em>, </em>this is now a remarkable kindness thou hast done me, in having inspired me with a holy desire to keep thy law; one thing is still necessary, that this same virtue pervade my whole life.” But as the word <em>righteousness </em>is ambiguous, my readers may, if they choose, understand it thus: Restore, defend, and maintain me for the sake of thy goodness, which thou art wont to show to all thy people. I have already pointed out the exposition which I prefer. </p></div>
