<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但遇着两水夹流的地方，就把船搁了浅。船头胶住不动，船尾被浪的猛力冲坏。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong><em>They thrust in the ship. </em>And then it might seem that both God had mocked Paul, and that he, with trifling, had brought his partners in a vain hope;<span class="cite-ref">(651)</span> but God did forthwith put away that error by giving them prosperous success. It was meet that when the ship was broken, they should be so discouraged, and that their souls should so melt, that despair might increase the glory of the miracle. For God useth to moderate and govern his works so, that he maketh some show of difficulty by reason of many lets [hindrances] which fall out. By this means he sharpeneth our senses unto greater attentiveness, that we may at length learn that, though all the world strive against him, yet will he have the victory. This is the reason why he had lieffer [rather] draw Paul and his companions to the shore after that the ship was lost,<span class="cite-ref">(652)</span> than bring the ship whole to land.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(651)</span></p><p>“ Socios naufragii vana spe lactasse,” had deluded his companions in shipwreck with a vain hope. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(652)</span></p><p>“ Fracta,” wrecked, </p></div></div>
