<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">论到这城中的房屋和犹大王的宫室，就是拆毁为挡敌人高垒和刀剑的，耶和华以色列的神如此说，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He now expresses what these hidden things were, <em>As to the houses, he says, (so it is literally) thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, as to the houses of this city, and as to the houses of the kings of Judah </em>The proposition; <span class="lang he-il">על</span>, upon, often means with regard to, concerning. He names the <em>houses </em>of the kings, for the kings of Judah were not satisfied, as it is well known, with one palace, but had many houses without the city. <em>As to the houses, </em>he says, <em>which had been thrown down </em>This is variously explained; the houses, say some, had been pulled down for the warlike engines, that is, that these engines might be made from the materials, and for the sword. The sense, however, would appear more obvious were we to take this view, that the houses had been thrown down by the warlike engines, and also by the sword, that is, by the violence of the enemies. The word, <span class="lang he-il">סללת</span><em>sallut, </em>as it has been already stated, is rendered by some fortifications; but when the storming of cities is spoken of, it means no doubt warlike machines, such as the engines to throw darts, or battering-rams: but we know not in what form they were made by the Jews and the Chaldeans. </p></div>
