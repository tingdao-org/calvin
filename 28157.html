<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我是大有忧愁，心里时常伤痛。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>That I have great sorrow, etc. </em>He dexterously manages so to cut short his sentence as not yet to express what he was going to say; for it was not as yet seasonable openly to mention the destruction of the Jewish nation. It may be added, that he thus intimates a greater measure of sorrow, as imperfect sentences are for the most part full of pathos. But he will presently express the cause of his sorrow, after having more fully testified his sincerity. </p><p>But the perdition of the Jews caused very great anguish to Paul, though he knew that it happened through the will and providence of God. We hence learn that the obedience we render to God’s providence does not prevent us from grieving at the destruction of lost men, though we know that they are thus doomed by the just judgment of God; for the same mind is capable of being influenced by these two feelings: that when it looks to God it can willingly bear the ruin of those whom he has decreed to destroy; and that when it turns its thoughts to men, it condoles with their evils. They are then much deceived, who say that godly men ought: to have apathy and insensibility, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀπάθειαν καὶ ἀναλγησίαν</span>) lest they should resist the decree of God. </p></div>
