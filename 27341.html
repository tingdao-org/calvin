<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">希律拿了彼得收在监里，交付四班兵丁看守，每班四个人，意思要在逾越节后，把他提出来，当着百姓办他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Adding four quaternions of soldiers. </em>Luke doth, in this place, declare by circumstances that Peter was, as it were, shut up in his grave, so that it might seem that he was quite past hope; for as they divided the day and night into four parts by three hours, so Herod divided the watches, that four soldiers might always keep watch, and that one quaternion might succeed another every third hour. He showeth the cause why he was not forthwith put to death, because it had been an heinous offense to put him to death in the Easter holidays; therefore, Herod doth not delay the time as doubtful what to do, but doth only wait for opportunity; yea, he maketh choice of a time, when as his gift may be more plausible, because there came a great multitude together from all parts unto the holy day. <span class="cite-ref">(753)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(753)</span> “Ad diem festum,” to the feast, or festival. </p></div></div>
