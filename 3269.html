<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">不可露了妇人的下体，又露她女儿的下体，也不可娶她孙女或是外孙女，露她们的下体，她们是骨肉之亲，这本是大恶。</div></div>
