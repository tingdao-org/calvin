<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">巴兰回答巴勒说，我岂不是告诉你说凡耶和华所说的，我必须遵行吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>But Balaam answered and said. </em>The mercenary prophet here confesses that he has no more power of himself to be silent than to speak. Nor is there any doubt but that he would excuse himself with servility to the proud king, to whom he would willingly have sold himself; as if, in his desire to avert the odium and blame from himself, he would state that he was carried away against his will by the Divine <em>afflatus. </em>At the same time he throws back the blame on Balak himself, who, though warned in time, had still foolishly sent to fetch him. The rest I have already expounded. </p></div>
