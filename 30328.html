<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们用舌头颂赞那为主为父的，又用舌头咒诅那照着神形像被造的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>Therewith</em>, or, <em>by it, bless we God</em>. It is a clear instance of its deadly poison, that it can thus through a monstrous levity transform itself; for when it pretends to bless God, it immediately curses him in his own image, even by cursing men. For since God ought to be blessed in all his works, he ought to be so especially as to men, in whom his image and glory peculiarly shine forth. It is then a hypocrisy not to be borne, when man employs the same tongue in blessing God and in cursing men. There can be then no calling on God, and his praises must necessarily cease, when evil-speaking prevails; for it is impious profanation of God’s name, which the tongue is virulent towards our brethren and pretends to praise him. That he may therefore rightly praise God, the view of evil speaking as to our neighbor must especially be corrected. </p></div>
