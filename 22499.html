<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">虽然藏在迦密山顶，我必搜寻，捉出他们来。虽然从我眼前藏在海底，我必命蛇咬他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now as to what he says, <em>I will command the serpent to bite them, </em>some understand by <span class="lang he-il">נחש</span>, <em>nuchesh, </em>not a serpent on hand, but the whale, or some other marine animal, as the leviathan, which is mentioned in Scripture; and we may learn from other parts of Scripture that “nachash” means not only a serpent, but also a whale or some animal living in the sea. In a word, God intimates, that he would be armed everywhere, whenever he should resolve to punish his adversaries, and that in all elements are means in readiness, by which he can destroy the wicked, who seek to escape from his hand. </p></div>
