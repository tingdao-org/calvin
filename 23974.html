<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那时，在犹太的，应当逃到山上。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains. </em>Having shown by the testimony of the prophet that, when the temple had been profaned, the services of the Law would soon afterwards be abolished, he adds, that fearful and appalling calamities will soon overtake the whole of <em>Judea, </em>so that there will be nothing more desirable than to withdraw a distance from it; and, at the same time, he states that they will be so sudden, that time will scarcely be time allowed for the most rapid flight. For such is the import of the expressions, <em>Let not him who is on the house-top enter into the house; let not him who is in the field turn back; </em>that is, lest, by attempting to save their property, they themselves perish. Again, <em>Woe to the women with child, and to them that give suck; </em>for they will not be in a fit condition for flight. Again, <em>Pray that your fight may not be in the winter; </em>that is, that neither a regard to the sacredness of the day, nor the roughness of the roads, nor the shortness of the clays, may prevent or retard your flight. The design of Christ therefore was, first, to arouse his followers, that they might no longer indulge the hope of ease and repose, and the enjoyments of an earthly kingdom; and, secondly, to fortify their minds, that they might not give way under ordinary calamities. Such an admonition, no doubt, was fir from being agreeable, but, in consequence of their stupidity, and the great weight of the calamities, it was highly necessary. </p></div>
