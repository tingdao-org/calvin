<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>That which is altogether just </em><span class="cite-ref">(131)</span> By an emphatic repetition God inculcates that judges should study equity with inflexible constancy; nor is this done without cause, for nothing is more likely to happen than that men’s minds should be clouded by favor or hatred. Besides there are so many quibbles whereby justice is perverted, that, unless judges are very cautious in watching against deception, they will often find themselves ensnared. </p><p><strong>(131)</strong> “Justitiam, justitiam.” — <em>Lat</em>. See Margin <em>A. V</em>. , “<em>Heb</em>. , Justice, justice.” </p></div>
