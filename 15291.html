<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>Listen, O Jehovah! to my prayer. </em>From the earnest repetition of his former requests in this and the subsequent verse, it is evident that he was oppressed with no ordinary degree of grief, and also agitated with extreme anxiety, From this example, we are taught that those who, having engaged in prayer once, allow themselves immediately to give over that exercise, provided God does not at once grant them their desire, betray the coldness and inconstancy of their hearts. Nor is this repetition of the same requests to be thought superfluous; for hereby the saints, by little and little, discharge their cares into the bosom of God, and this importunity is a sacrifice of a sweet savor before Him. When the Psalmist says, <em>God will hear me when I cry in the day of trouble, </em>he makes a particular application to himself of the truth which he had just now stated, That God is merciful and gracious to all who call upon him. </p></div>
