<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">主对他说，起来，往直街去，在犹大的家里，访问一个大数人名叫扫罗。他正祷告。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>For, behold, he prayeth. </em>Luke showeth that Paul gave himself <span class="cite-ref">(585)</span> to prayer those three days; and peradventure this was one cause why he fasted, although it be certain, as I have already said, that he suffered such long hunger, because he was after a sort deprived of sense, as men which are in a trance use to be. Christ doth assuredly speak of no short prayer <span class="cite-ref">(586)</span> in this place, but he doth rather show that Paul continued in this kind of exercise until he should be more quiet in mind. For besides other causes of terror, that voice might sound in his ears, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” And it is not to be doubted but that the careful <span class="cite-ref">(587)</span> looking for a perfect revelation did marvellously trouble his mind; but this was the reason why the Lord caused him to wait three days, that he might the more kindle in him an earnest desire to pray. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(585)</span> “Fuisse intentum,” was intent. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(586)</span> “Precatione momenti,” momentary or ejaculatory prayer. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(587)</span> “Anxia,” anxious. </p></div></div>
