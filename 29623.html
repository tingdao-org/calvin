<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>Ye know perfectly</em>. He places exact knowledge in contrast with an anxious desire of investigation. But what is it that he says the Thessalonians know accurately? <span class="cite-ref">(591)</span> It is, that the day of Christ will come suddenly and unexpectedly, so as to take unbelievers by surprise, as a thief does those that are asleep. This, however, is opposed to evident tokens, which might portend afar off his coming to the world. Hence it were foolish to wish to determine the time precisely from presages or prodigies. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(591)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Plenement et certainement</span>;” — “Fully and certainly.” </p></div></div>
