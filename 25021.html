<div class="CUV verse">凡听见他的，都希奇他的聪明，和他的应对。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>And all who heard him </em>Two things here claim our attention. <em>All who heard him were astonished: </em>for they reckoned it a miracle, that a child should frame his questions with such correctness and propriety. Again, they <em>heard </em>Christ, and thus acted the part rather of scholars than of teachers. He had not yet been called by the Father, to avow himself a public teacher of the Church, and therefore satisfied himself with putting modest questions to the doctors. Yet there is no room to doubt that, in this first attempt, he already began to tax their perverse way of teaching: for what Luke afterwards says about <em>answers, </em>I consider as denoting, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, any kind of discourse. </p></div>
