<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我从哪里得肉给这百姓吃呢？他们都向我哭号说，你给我们肉吃吧。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? </em>Justly, indeed, does he accuse the people, and deny that he is possessed of flesh wherewith to satisfy so great a multitude; but he is wrong in expostulating with God, as if he were burdened beyond his strength; for, since God knew that he was unequal to so many difficulties, He supported him by the influence of His Spirit. But he sinned most grossly in the conclusion of his complaint, requesting God to kill him. In these words we see how far even the best of God’s servants may be carried, when they give too great indulgence to their passions. For it is the longing of despair to seek that we may be removed from the world, so that death may bring our troubles to an end. Since the impetuosity of his grief hurried away Moses God’s most chosen servant to this, what might not happen to us, if impatience should hold dominion over our hearts? Let us, then, learn to put a stop to this disease in good time. </p></div>
