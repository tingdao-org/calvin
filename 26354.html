<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; </em>that is, those to whom the rulers had communicated their plots, and who knew how much Christ was hated; for the people at large — as we saw lately — looked upon this as a dream, or as madness. Those persons, therefore, who knew with what inveterate rage the rulers of their nation burned against Christ, have some reason for wondering that, while Christ <em>in the temple </em>not only converses openly but preaches freely, the rulers <em>say nothing to him. </em>But they err in this respect, that in a miracle altogether Divine they do not take into account the providence of God. Thus carnal men, whenever they behold any unusual work of God, do indeed wonder, but no consideration of the power of God ever enters into their mind. But it is our duty to examine more wisely the works of God; and especially when wicked men, with all their contrivances, do not hinder the progress of the Gospel so much as they would desire, we ought to be fully persuaded that their efforts have been rendered fruitless, because God, by interposing his word, has defeated them. </p></div>
