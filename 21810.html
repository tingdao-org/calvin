<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">尼布甲尼撒王差人将总督，钦差，巡抚，臬司，藩司，谋士，法官，和各省的官员都召了来，为尼布甲尼撒王所立的像行开光之礼。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>I do not know the derivation of the word “<em>Satra </em>p;” but manifestly all these are names of magistracies, and I allow myself to translate the words freely, since they are not Hebrew, and the Jews are equally ignorant of their origin. Some of them, indeed, appear too subtle; but they assert nothing but what is frivolous and foolish. We must be content with the simple expression — <em>he sent to collect the satraps </em></p></div>
