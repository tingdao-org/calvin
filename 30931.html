<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这些人未曾沾染妇女，他们原是童身。羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随他。他们是从人间买来的，作初熟的果子归与神和羔羊。</div></div>
