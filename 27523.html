<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>When they saw, etc. </em>They were desired to part presently; yet it became them to regard the brethren, lest the tender seed of the gospel should perish, and undoubtedly they would have tarried longer if they had been suffered, but the prayers and requests of the magistrates were imperious and armed, which they are enforced to obey. Nevertheless, they foreslow [neglect] not their necessary duty, but they exhort the brethren to be constant. And whereas they went straight to Lydia, it is a token, that though the Church were increased, yet that woman was the chief even of a greater number, as touching diligence in duties of godliness;<span class="cite-ref">(239)</span> and that appeareth more plainly thereby, because all the godly were assembled in her house. </p><p><strong>(239)</strong></p><p>“ In officiis pictatis,” in offices of piety. </p></div>
