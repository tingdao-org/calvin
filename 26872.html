<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And seeth the linen clothes lying. The linen clothes </em>might be regarded as the spoils, intended to lead to the belief of Christ’s resurrection; for it was not probable that his body had been stripped naked, in order that it might be removed to another place. This would not have been done by a friend, nor even by an enemy. </p></div>
