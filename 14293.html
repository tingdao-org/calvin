<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Hear, O Jehovah! my voice. </em>The Psalmist returns again to prayer, and in doing so, he declares with what armor he was furnished to break through his temptations. By the word <em>cry, </em>he expresses his vehemence, as I have elsewhere said, that he may thereby move God the sooner to help him. For the same purpose, also, he a little after mentions his misery, because the more the faithful are oppressed, the more does their very need induce God to extend his favor towards them. </p></div>
