<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们正想要杀他，有人报信给营里的千夫长说，耶路撒冷合城都乱了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>As they sought to kill him. </em>Assuredly the force of Satan appeareth therein, in that he driveth the people headlong into such rage, that when they have shut the doors of the temple, being not content with mean punishment, they conspire to put Paul to death. We must thus think with ourselves that Satan doth prick forward the enemies of godliness, lest their rage, how cruel and troublesome soever it be, trouble us. On the other side appeareth the wonderful goodness of God, when as he raiseth up the chief captain at a sudden, that he may deliver Paul from death. He himself thought upon no such thing, but he came to appease the tumult which was raised among the people; but the Lord showeth a more evident token of his providence, because Paul’s life was delivered from such present danger without man’s counsel. Thus doth he suffer the faithful not only to labor, but to be almost oppressed, that he may deliver them from death more wonderfully. Luke calleth him the chief captain [tribune] of the band<span class="cite-ref">(491)</span> improperly, seeing every chief captain was set over a thousand, which cloth also appear by the text, where he saith that the chief captain took with him under captains?<span class="cite-ref">(492)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(491)</span></p><p>“ Tribunum cohortis,” tribune of the cohort. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(492)</span></p><p>“ Centurionos... a tribuno assumptos,” that the tribune took with him centurions. </p></div></div>
