<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们在旷野所行的路上，也曾见耶和华你们的神抚养你们，如同人抚养儿子一般，直等你们来到这地方。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>And it, the wilderness where thou hast seen. </em>The constant course of God’s grace is here commemorated; from whence they might safely infer, that He, who had pursued them with so many benefits, would still be the same in this crowning act. He, therefore, uses the image of <em>bearing, </em>because the way would have been by no means passable unless God had borne them, as it were, on His shoulders, just as a father is wont to bear his infant child. Thus, on the one hand, the incredible goodness of God is exalted, who had deigned so far to condescend as to take up the people in His arms; and, on the other hand, the people are reminded of their own infirmity, for, unless upheld by the power of God, they would scarcely have been competent to advance a step. Elsewhere, retaining a portion of this similitude, Moses compares God to an eagle, <span class="cite-ref">(56)</span> who bears her young upon her wings, and teaches them to fly. And surely, unless (the Israelites) had been uplifted by supernatural means, they would never have been equal to a hundredth part of the difficulties they encountered. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(56)</span><span class="bvs">Deu_32:11</span>.
