<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">惟有那不知道的，作了当受责打的事，必少受责打因为多给谁，就向谁多取。多托谁，就向谁多要。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>To whomsoever much hath been given. </em>Christ shows by another circumstance, that the more highly favored disciples ought to be visited with severer punishment, if they despise their calling, and abandon themselves without reserve to every kind of licentiousness; because the more eminent a man is, he ought to consider that so much the more has been entrusted to him, and on the express condition that he shall one day render an account of it. In the same proportion, therefore, as any of us is endued with higher gifts, if he does not, like a field which has been cultivated at greater expense, yield to the Lord more abundant produce, the abuse of that grace which he has profaned, or uselessly withheld, will cost him dear. </p></div>
