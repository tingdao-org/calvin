<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Thy pomp is laid down in the grave. </em>He mentions royal pomp, that this change may be more attentively considered by comparing the latter with the former; and he shows that that pomp could not prevent him from being reduced to the same level with other men. Under the term <em>musical instruments</em>, he includes all the luxuries and enjoyments in which kings are wont to indulge; because not only does the sweetness of music cause them to forget death, but the mad <em>sound </em>of them drives away all sadness, and in some respects stupifies the minds of men. </p><p><em>The worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. </em>In this second clause, the dead say jestingly, “Thou hast obtained a bed worthy of thee; for <em>the worms </em>serve thee for tapestry or a soft couch, and <em>the worm </em>serves for a splendid coverlet.” In a word, there is here exhibited to us a lively painting of the foolish confidence of men, who, intoxicated with their present enjoyments and prosperity, flatter themselves. This doctrine ought to be carefully pondered; for though men be well aware of their condition, and have death before their eyes, yet overrun by ambition, and soothed by pleasures, and even fascinated by empty show, they forget themselves. </p></div>
