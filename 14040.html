<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">穷乏人必不永久被忘，困苦人的指望，必不永远落空。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>For the poor shall not always be forgotten. </em>The assertion that God will not forsake the poor and afflicted for ever, is a confirmation of the preceding sentence. By it he intimates, that they may indeed seem to be forsaken for a time. Let us, therefore, remember that God has promised his assistance to us, not in the way of preventing our afflictions, but of at length succouring us after we have been long subdued under the cross. David speaks expressly of <em>hope </em>or <em>expectation, </em>thereby to encourage us to prayer. The reason why God seems to take no notice of our afflictions is, because he would have us to awaken him by means of our prayers; for when he hears our requests, (as if he began but then to be mindful of us,) he stretches forth his powerful hand to help us. David again repeats that this is not done immediately, in order that we may persevere in hoping well, even although our expectations may not be instantly gratified. </p></div>
