<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那时，巴比伦王的军队正攻打耶路撒冷，又攻打犹大所剩下的城邑，就是拉吉和亚西加。原来犹大的坚固城只剩下这两座。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He again repeats that Jerusalem was then surrounded by <em>the army of the king of Babylon, </em>as well as the other cities of Judah, which he names, even <em>Lachish </em>and <em>Azekah. </em>He seems, therefore, indirectly to reprove the arrogance of Zedekiah, for he still retained his high spirits, when yet he was reduced to such straits. All the cities of Judah, — how many were they? Two, says the Prophet. This, then, was no unsuitable way of indirectly exposing to ridicule the vain confidence of the king, who still thought that he could overcome the enemy, though he was master only of three cities, that is, Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah. But the Prophet gives a reason why these cities did not immediately fall into the hands of the king of Babylon, because they were <em>fortified. </em>It hence follows, that the other cities were taken without trouble, or that they surrendered of their own accord. Zedekiah the king was then deprived of his power, and yet he had not relinquished the ferocity of his mind, nor was he terrified by the threatenings of the Prophet; and this was a proof of extreme madness. For he hence appears that he was alienated in mind; for. the dreadful hand of God was put forth against him, and yet he rushed headlong to his own ruin as a wild beast destitute of reason. Let us proceed, — </p></div>
