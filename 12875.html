<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">筵宴的日子过了，约伯打发人去叫他们自洁。他清早起来，按着他们众人的数目献燔祭。因为他说，恐怕我儿子犯了罪，心中弃掉神。约伯常常这样行。</div></div>
