<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这是照神从万世以前，在我们主基督耶稣里所定的旨意。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>According to the eternal purpose. </em>How carefully does he guard against the objection, that the purpose of God has been changed! A third time, he repeats that the decree was eternal and unchangeable, but must be carried into effect by <em>Christ Jesus our Lord, </em>because in him it was made. Thus he declares, that the proper time for publishing this decree belongs to the kingdom of Christ. Literally the words run, “according to the eternal purpose (<span class="lang el-gr">ἣν ἐποίησοεν</span>) <em>which he made. </em>” But I consider the meaning to be, <em>which he purposed; </em>because the present discussion does not relate solely to the execution of the decree, but to the appointment itself, which, though it took place before all ages, was known to God only — till the manifestation of Christ. </p></div>
