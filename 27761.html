<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这人被犹太人拿住，将要杀害，我得知他是罗马人，就带兵丁下去救他出来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>This man being taken. </em>This was spoken odiously concerning the Jews, that he might purchase more favor for Paul, that a man, being a Roman, was by them sore beaten, and almost slain; also, he commendeth him for the right and privilege of his freedom, that he may be the more courteously handled. Furthermore, this commendation was not purchased by prayer or flattery, neither was it bought with money. How came it to pass, then, that the chief captain did show himself so courteous freely to an obscure man, and whom all men did hate, save only because the Lord had appointed him to be his servant’s patron? Therefore, we see how he governeth the tongues and hands of the infidels to the profit of those that be his.</p></div>
