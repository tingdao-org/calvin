<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们若单爱那爱你们的人。有什么赏赐呢？就是税吏不也是这样行吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>Do not even the publicans the same? </em>In the same sense, Luke calls them <em>sinners, </em>that is, wicked and unprincipled men. Not that the office is condemned in itself; for the <em>publicans </em>were collectors of taxes, and as princes have a right to impose taxes, so it is lawful to levy them from the people. But they are so called, because men of this class are usually covetous and rapacious, nay, deceitful and cruel; and because among the Jews they were the agents of a wicked tyranny. If any one shall conclude from the words of Christ, that <em>publicans </em>are the basest of all men, he will argue ill, for our Lord employs the ordinary phraseology. His meaning is: those who are nearly devoid of humanity have some appearance of discharging mutual duties, when they see it to be for their own advantage. </p></div>
