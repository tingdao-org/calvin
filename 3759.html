<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">将要起营的时候，亚伦和他儿子把圣所和圣所的一切器具遮盖完了，哥辖的子孙就要来抬，只是不可摸圣物，免得他们死亡。会幕里这些物件是哥辖子孙所当抬的</div></div>
