<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以拦也在那里，她的群众在她坟墓的四围，都是被杀倒在刀下，未受割礼而下阴府的。他们曾在活人之地使人惊恐，并且与下坑的人一同担当羞辱。</div></div>
