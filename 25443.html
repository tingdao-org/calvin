<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">说话的时候，有一个法利赛人请耶稣同他吃饭。耶稣就进去坐席。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This narrative agrees in some respects, but not entirely, with the doctrine laid down by Matthew, (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:1</span>,) that Christ, in order to correct the superstition of the people, and particularly of the scribes, intentionally disregarded outward ceremonies of human invention, which the Jews were too solicitous to observe. God had prescribed in his Law certain kinds of <em>washings, </em>that by means of them he might train his people usefully to the consideration of true purity. The Jews, not satisfied with this moderate portion had added many other washings, and more especially, that no person should partake of food till he had been washed with the water of purification, as Mark relates more minutely, (<span class="bvs">Mar_12:3</span>,) and as is also evident from John, (<span class="bvs">Joh_2:6</span>.) This fault was accompanied by wicked confidence; for they cared little about the spiritual worship of God, and thought that they had perfectly discharged their duty, when the figure was substituted in the place of God. Christ is fully aware that his neglect of this ceremony will give offense, but he declines to observe it, in order to show that God sets very little value on outward cleanness, but demands the spiritual righteousness of the heart. </p></div>
