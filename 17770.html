<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那日他们要向以色列人吼叫，向海浪？？訇。人若望地，只见黑暗艰难。光明在云中变为昏暗。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>He shall roar against him. </em><span class="cite-ref">(91)</span> The Prophet adds this, that the Jews may understand that the fierce attack of the Chaldeans is not accidental, but that they have been appointed by God and are guided by his hand. By <em>the roaring of the sea </em>he means an attack so violent that it will look like a deluge, by which the whole of Judea will suffer shipwreck. He likewise cuts off all hope by foretelling that the punishment will have no alleviation and no end. “The Jews,” he says, “will do what is usually done in a season of perplexity, will cast their eyes up and down to discover the means of escape; but in whatever direction they look, whether to heaven or to earth, they will find no relief whatever; for on all sides distresses and calamities will overwhelm them.” This mode of expression has come to be frequently employed even by the common people, when misery and ruin appear on all sides, and no escape or relief can be found. This must unavoidably happen when the Lord pursues us, so that his uplifted arm meets our eyes on every side, and, wherever we turn, we behold his creatures armed against us to execute his judgments; for we may sometimes escape the hand of men, but how can we escape the hand of God? </p><p><strong>(91)</strong><em>And in that day they shall roar against them</em>. — Eng.
