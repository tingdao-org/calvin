<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们心里若怀着苦毒的嫉妒和分争，就不可自夸，也不可说谎话抵挡真道。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>l4</strong><em>But if ye have bitter envying</em>. He points out the fruits which proceed from that extreme austerity which is contrary to meekness; for immoderate rigor necessarily begets mischievous emulations, which presently break forth into contentions. It is, indeed, an improper mode of speaking, to place contentions in the heart; but this affects not the meaning; for the object was to shew that the evil disposition of the heart is the fountain of these evils. </p><p>He has called <em>envying</em>, or <em>emulation</em>, <em>bitter</em>; for it prevails not, except when minds are so infected with the poison of malignity, that they turn all things into bitterness. <span class="cite-ref">(125)</span></p><p>That we may then really glory that we are the children of God, he bids us to act calmly and meekly towards our brethren; otherwise he declares that we are lying in assuming the Christian name. But it is not without reason that he has added the associate of envying, even <em>strife</em>, or contention, for contests and quarrels ever arise from malignity and envy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(125)</span> A similar order as to the words is found here as in the former verse: bitter envying is occasioned by strife of contention. There may be envying without contention, but it is contention that commonly makes it bitter. </p></div></div>
