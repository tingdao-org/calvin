<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">地必全然空虚，尽都荒凉。因为这话是耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>By emptying shall the earth be emptied. </em>He confirms what he had already said, and declares that those changes will not be accidental, but that they are the work of God. In the first verse, he had expressly stated that God is making preparations for emptying the earth: he now asserts that it will happen, and adds the reason, that God hath purposed and determined to do it. </p></div>
