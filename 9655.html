<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列王看了信就撕裂衣服，说，我岂是神，能使人死使人活呢？这人竟打发人来，叫我治好他的大麻疯。你们看一看，这人何以寻隙攻击我呢？</div></div>
