<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>When, my spirit</em>, <em>etc</em>. Though he owns here that he felt anxiety, yet he confirms what he had said as to the constancy of his faith. The figure which he uses of his spirit being <em>perplexed</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(246)</span> aptly represents the state of the mind in alternating between various resolutions when there was no apparent outgate from danger, and increasing its distress by resorting to all kinds of devices. He adds, that though there was no apparent way of safety, God knew from the beginning in what way his deliverance should be effected. Others put a different meaning upon this clause, <em>thou knowest my way, </em>as if David asserted God to have been witness of his integrity, but the other is the more correct, that God knew the way to deliver him, while his own mind was distracted by a variety of thoughts, and yet could not conceive any mode of extrication. The words teach us, when we have tried every remedy and know not what to do, to rest satisfied with the conviction that God is acquainted with our afflictions, and condescends to care for us, as Abraham said — </p><p>“The Lord will provide.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_22:8</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(246)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or c’est une belle similitude quand il dit que son esprit a este en tortille et enveloppe</span>,” etc. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
