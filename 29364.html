<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>I give thanks</em>. He begins with thanksgiving <span class="cite-ref">(31)</span> on two accounts — <em>first</em>, that he may by this token shew his love to the Philippians; and secondly, that, by commending them as to the past, he may exhort them, also, to perseverance in time to come. He adduces, also, another evidence of his love — the anxiety which he exercised in supplications. It is to be observed, however, that, whenever he makes mention of things that are joyful, he immediately breaks forth into thanksgiving — a practice with which we ought also to be familiar. We must, also, take notice, what things they are for which he gives thanks to God, — the fellowship of the Philippians in the gospel of Christ; for it follows from this, that it ought to be ascribed to the grace of God. When he says, <em>upon every remembrance of you</em>, he means, “As often as I remember you.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(31)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne protestation, qu’il est ioyeux de leur bien</span>;” — “A protestation, that he is delighted on account of their welfare.” </p></div></div>
