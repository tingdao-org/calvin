<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">说，有两个人上殿里去祷告。一个是法利赛人，一个是税吏。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Two men went up. </em>Christ makes a comparison between the two men, both of whom, by <em>going up to pray, </em>seem to manifest the same ardor of piety, while yet they are exceedingly unlike. <em>The Pharisee, </em>possessing outward sanctity, approaches to God with a commendation which he pronounces on his whole life, and as if he had an undoubted right to offer the sacrifice of praise. <em>The publican, </em>on the other hand, as if he had been some outcast, and knew that he was unworthy to approach, presents himself with trembling and with humble confession. Christ affirms that <em>the Pharisee </em>was rejected, and that the prayers of <em>the publican </em>were acceptable to God. The reasons why the Pharisee was rejected are stated to be these two: <em>he trusted in himself that he was righteous, and despised others </em></p></div>
