<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>But as it is written, etc. </em>He confirms by the testimony of Isaiah what he had said of the <em>evidence </em>of his apostleship; for in <span class="bvs">Isa_52:15</span>, speaking of the kingdom of Messiah, among other things he predicts, that the knowledge of Christ would be spread among the Gentiles throughout the whole world, that his name would be declared to those by whom it had not been heard of before. It was meet that this should be done by the Apostles, to whom the command was specifically given. Hence the apostleship of Paul was made evident from this circumstance, — that this prophecy was fulfilled in him. <span class="cite-ref">(457)</span></p><p>It is absurd for any one to attempt to apply what is here said to the pastoral office; for we know that in Churches rightly formed, where the truth of the gospel has been already received, Christ’s name must be constantly preached. Paul then was a preacher of Christ, yet unknown to foreign nations, for this end, — that after his departure the same doctrine should be daily proclaimed in every place by the mouth of the pastors; for it is certain that the Prophet speaks of the commencement of the kingdom of Christ. </p><p><strong>(457)</strong><span class="bvs">Isa_52:15</span>. The quotation is literally from the Septuagint, and is nearly according to the Hebrew, only the tense is altered, it being the past in that language, as prophecies are often found to be, in order to show their certainty. The Hebrew is as follows, — </p><p>For what had not been told them, have they seen,<span class="cite-ref"><LineBreak /></span>And what they had not heard, have they understood. </p><p>To render the last verb “consider,” as in our version, is not proper; it means to distinguish between things, to discern, to understand. It bears strictly the same meaning with the Greek verb here used. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
