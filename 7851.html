<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我父阿，看看你外袍的衣襟在我手中。我割下你的衣襟，没有杀你。你由此可以知道我没有恶意叛逆你。你虽然猎取我的命，我却没有得罪你。</div></div>
