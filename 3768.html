<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">革顺人各族所办的事，所抬的物乃是这样，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>This is the service of the families of the Gershonites. </em>The tasks which He enjoins upon the sons of Gershon, as well as the sons of Merari, are apparently mean and laborious, for it was a hard and also a servile work to carry the curtains and the tabernacle, together with its coverings, the boards, too, and the bars, and the pillars. But hence we learn that in God’s service nothing is to be despised, but that each and every part of our duty should be cheerfully performed, inasmuch as it ought abundantly to satisfy us, that God should have deigned to choose us as ministers of His sanctuary, so that neither weariness nor pride should ever hinder us in our duty. </p></div>
