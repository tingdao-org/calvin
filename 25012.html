<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>Made acknowledgment also to God </em><span class="cite-ref">(206)</span> The holy melody, which proceeded from the lips of Simeon and Anna, is praised by Luke, in order that believers may exhort each other to sing with one mouth the praises of God, and may give mutual replies. When he says, that Anna <em>spake of him to all who looked for redemption in Jerusalem, </em>he again points out the small number of the godly. For the substance of faith lay in this expectation; and it is evident, that there were few who actually cherished it in their minds. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(206)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Louoit aussi le Seigneur</span>;” — “praised also the Lord.” </p></div></div>
