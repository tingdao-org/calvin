<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>For which I have boasted. </em>He shows the good opinion that he had of them from this, that he had, in a manner, stood forward as their surety by asserting their readiness. But what if he rashly asserted more than the case warranted? For there is some appearance of this, inasmuch as he boasted, that they had been <em>ready a year before </em>with it, while he is still urging them to have it in readiness. I answer, that his words are not to be understood as though Paul had declared, that what they were to give was already laid aside in the chest, but he simply mentioned what had been resolved upon among them. This involves no blame in respect of fickleness or mistake. It was, then, of this promise that Paul spoke. <span class="cite-ref">(707)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(707)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le Sainct Apostre donc parloit de ceste promesse des Corinthiens</span>;” — “The holy Apostle, therefore, spoke of this promise of the Corinthians.” </p></div></div>
