<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And he sent him away to his house. </em>Christ does not suffer him to return to <em>Bethsaida</em>, where there were many that had beheld the miracle. This is conjectured by some to have been done, because Christ intended to punish the inhabitants of that place by depriving them of the enjoyment of his favor. Whatever might be the reason, it is certain that no miracle was performed by him in order to remain perpetually buried, but that he intended to have it concealed along with many others, till, after having expiated by his death the sins of the world, <span class="cite-ref">(435)</span> he should ascend to the glory of the Father. </p><p><strong>(435)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Iusques a ce qu’ayant par sa mort accompli la satisfaction des pechez du monde</span>;” — “till having by his death rendered full satisfaction for the sins of the world.” </p></div>
