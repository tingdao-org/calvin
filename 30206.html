<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">灭了烈火的猛势，脱了刀剑的锋刃，软弱变为刚强，争战显出勇敢，打退外邦的全军。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Out of weakness were made strong, etc. </em>Chrysostom refers this to the restoration of the Jews from exile, in which they were like men without hope; I do not disapprove of its applications to Hezekiah. We might at the same time extend it wider, that the Lord, by his hand, raised on high his saints, whenever they were cast down; and brought help to their weakness, so as to endue them with full strength. </p></div>
