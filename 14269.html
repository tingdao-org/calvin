<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我心里的愁苦甚多。求你救我脱离我的祸患。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>The troubles of my heart are enlarged. </em>In this verse he acknowledges not only that he had to contend outwardly with his enemies and the troubles which they occasioned him, but that he was also afflicted inwardly with sorrow and anguish of heart. It is also necessary to observe the manner of expression which he here employs, and by which he intimates that the weight and number of his trials had accumulated to such an extent that they filled his whole heart, even as a flood of waters bursting every barrier, and extending far and wide, covers a whole country. Now, when we see that the heart of David had sometimes been wholly filled with anguish, we need no longer wonder if at times the violence of temptation overwhelm us; but let us ask with David, that even whilst we are as it were at the point of despair, God would succor us. </p></div>
