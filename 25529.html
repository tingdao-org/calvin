<div class="comment-content"><p>I have resolved to place in immediate connection some events which are detailed by Luke alone, without a direct reference to dates; for on that point, as we have formerly mentioned, the Evangelists did not care much about exactness. We shall afterwards find a more suitable time for returning to the <em>Harmony of the Three Evangelists. </em></p></div>
