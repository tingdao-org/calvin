<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>The cities of Aroer are forsaken. </em>It is not probable that <em>Aroer </em>here denotes the city which is mentioned elsewhere, (<span class="bvs">Num_32:34</span>;) but it is rather the name of a country. He draws the picture of a country which has been ruined; for he shews that those places in which cities had been built will be devoted to pasture, and that no habitation will be left there but huts and shepherds’ tents; for if any inhabitants remained, the shepherds would drive their flocks to some other place. </p></div>
