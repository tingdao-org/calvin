<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">祭司长拾起银钱来说，这是血价，不可放在库里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>It is not lawful for us to throw it into the treasury. </em>Hence it plainly appears that hypocrites, by attending to nothing more than the outward appearance, are guilty of gross trifling with God. Provided that they do not violate their <em>Corban, </em>(<span class="bvs">Mar_7:11</span>,) they imagine that in other matters they are pure, and give themselves no concern about the infamous bargain, by which they, not less than Judas, had provoked against themselves the vengeance of God. But if it was <em>unlawful to put into the </em>sacred <em>treasury the price of blood, </em>why was it <em>lawful </em>for them to take the money out of it? for all their wealth was derived from the offerings of the temple, and from no other source did they take what they now scruple to mingle again with it as being polluted. Now, whence came the pollution but from themselves? </p></div>
