<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">故此，我所愿意的善，我反不作。我所不愿意的恶，我倒去作。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong>The same view is to be taken of the expression which next follows, — that he <em>did not the good </em>which he <em>desired</em>, but, on the contrary, <em>the evil </em>which he <em>desired not: </em>for the faithful, however rightly they may be influenced, are yet so conscious of their own infirmity, that they can deem no work proceeding from them as blameless. For as Paul does not here treat of some of the faults of the godly, but delineates in general the whole course of their life, we conclude that their best works are always stained with some blots of sin, so that no reward can be hoped, unless God pardons them. </p><p>He at last repeats the sentiment, — that, as far as he was endued with celestial light, he was a true witness and subscriber to the righteousness of the law. It hence follows, that had the pure integrity of our nature remained, the law would not have brought death on us, and that it is not adverse to the man who is endued with a sound and right mind and abhors sin. But to restore health is the work of our heavenly Physician. </p></div>
