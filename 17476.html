<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我就看明神一切的作为。知道人查不出日光之下所作的事。任凭他费多少力寻查，都查不出来。就是智慧人虽想知道，也是查不出来。</div></div>
