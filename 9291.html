<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华的话临到哈拿尼的儿子先知耶户，责备巴沙和他的家，因他行耶和华眼中看为恶的一切事，以他手所作的惹耶和华发怒，像耶罗波安的家一样，又因他杀了耶罗波安的全家。</div></div>
