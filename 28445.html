<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong>When he says that <em>while persecuted he suffers it, </em>and that he <em>prays </em>for his <em>revilers</em>, he intimates that he is not merely afflicted and abased by God, by means of the cross, but is also endowed with a disposition to abase himself willingly. In this, perhaps, he gives a stroke to the false apostles, who were so effeminate and tender, that they could not bear to be touched even with your little finger. In speaking of their <em>laboring </em>he adds — <em>with our own hands</em>, to express more fully the meanness of his employments <span class="cite-ref">(243)</span> — “I do not merely gain a livelihood for myself by my own labor, but by mean labor, <em>working with my own hands</em>. ” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(243)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que c’estoit vn mestier ville, et mechanique</span>;” — “That it was a mean and mechanical occupation.” </p></div></div>
