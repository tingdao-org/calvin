<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣说，妇人，你当信我，时候将到，你们拜父，也不在这山上，也不在耶路撒冷。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Woman, believe me. </em>In the first part of this reply, he briefly sets aside the ceremonial worship which had been appointed under the Law; for when he says that the hour is at hand when there shall be no peculiar and fixed place for worship, he means that what Moses delivered was only for a time, and that the time was now approaching when the partition-wall (<span class="bvs">Eph_2:14</span>) should be thrown down. In this manner he extends the worship of God far beyond its former narrow limits, that the Samaritans might become partakers of it. </p><p><em>The hour cometh. </em>He uses the present tense instead of the future; but the meaning is, that the repeal of the Law is already at hand, so far as relates to the Temple, and Priesthood, and other outward ceremonies. By calling God Father, he seems indirectly to contrast Him with the Fathers whom the woman had mentioned, and to convey this instruction, that God will be a common Father to all, so that he will be generally worshipped without distinction of places or nations. </p></div>
