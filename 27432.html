<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>When they had said thus. </em>Luke said before that they did not only use words, but they ran also with violence into the multitude.<span class="cite-ref">(39)</span> Now he addeth, that the fury of the people was scarce appeased<span class="cite-ref">(40)</span> with that vehemency, whereby appeareth how mad and untamed the heat of the world is toward idolatry. For if they believe the [them] gods, why do they not believe their word, whereby they put from them false honor? But all idolaters are sick of this disease, that they are oftentimes ready to shake off the yoke, unless religion be subject to their will and pleasure. Wherefore, no marvel if the prophets say oftentimes that men are carried into the blind affection of superstitions, even as brute beasts are carried into their lust. </p><p><strong>(39)</strong></p><p>“ Sed etiam cure impetu irruisse in turbam,” but also rushed impetuously among the multitude. </p><p><strong>(40)</strong></p><p>“ Repressum,” repressed. </p></div>
