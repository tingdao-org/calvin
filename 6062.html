<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们回答约书亚说，因为有人实在告诉你的仆人，耶和华你的神曾吩咐他的仆人摩西，把这全地赐给你们，并在你们面前灭绝这地的一切居民，所以我们为你们的缘故甚怕丧命，就行了这事。</div></div>
