<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">彼拉多说，你们有看守的兵。去吧，尽你们所能的，把守妥当。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>65.</strong><em>You have a guard. </em>By these words, Pilate means that he grants their request by permitting them to post soldiers to keep watch. This, permission bound them more firmly, so that they could not escape by any evasion; for though they were not ashamed to break out against Christ after his resurrection, yet with Pilate’s signet they as truly shut their own mouths as they shut up the sepulcher. </p></div>
