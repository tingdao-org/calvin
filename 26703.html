<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们要常在我里面，我也常在你们里面。枝子若不常在葡萄树上，自己就不能结果子。你们若不常在我里面，也是这样。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Abide in me. </em>He again exhorts them to be earnest and careful in keeping the grace which they had received, for the carelessness of the flesh can never be sufficiently aroused. And, indeed, Christ has no other object in view than to keep us </p><p>as a hen keepeth her chickens under her wings, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_23:37</span>) </p><p>lest our indifference should carry us away, and make us fly to our destruction. In order to prove that he did not begin the work of our salvation for the purpose of leaving it imperfect in the middle of the course, he promises that his Spirit will always be efficacious in us, if we do not prevent him. <em>Abide in me</em>, says he; <em>for I am ready to abide in you </em>And again, <em>He who abideth in me beareth much fruit. </em>By these words he declares that all who have a living root in him are fruit-bearing <em>branches </em></p></div>
