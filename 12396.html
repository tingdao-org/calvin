<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我也抖着胸前的衣襟，说，凡不成就这应许的，愿神照样抖他离开家产和他劳碌得来的，直到抖空了。会众都说，阿们。又赞美耶和华。百姓就照着所应许的去行。</div></div>
