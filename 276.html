<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为耶和华在那里变乱天下人的言语，使众人分散在全地上，所以那城名叫巴别（就是变乱的意思）。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Therefore is the name of it called Babel</em>. Behold what they gained by their foolish ambition to acquire a name! They hoped that an everlasting memorial of their origin would be engraven on the tower; God not only frustrates their vain expectation, but brands them with eternal disgrace, to render them execrable to all posterity, on account of the great mischief indicted on the human race, through their fault. They gain, indeed, a name, but not each as they would have chosen: thus does God opprobriously cast down the pride of those who usurp to themselves honors to which they have no title. Here also is refuted the error of those who deduce the origin of Babylon from Jupiter Belus. <span class="cite-ref">(331)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(331)</span><span class="lang he-il">בבל</span>, (<em>Babel</em>,) is derived from <span class="lang he-il">בלל</span>, (<em>balel</em>,) which signifies to confound. See Schindler’s Lexicon, sub voce <span class="lang he-il">בלל</span>. The name Babel signifies, as Bishop Patrick says, “confusion; so frivolous is their conceit, who make it to have been called by this name, from Babylon, the son of Belus.” — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
