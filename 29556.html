<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所亲爱的医生路加，和底马问你们安。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Luke saluteth you. </em>I do not agree with those who understand this to be Luke the Evangelist; for I am of opinion that he was too well known to stand in need of such a designation, and he would have been signalized by a more magnificent eulogium. He would, undoubtedly, have called him his fellow-helper, or at least his companion and participant in his conflicts. I rather conjecture that he was absent at that time, and that it is another of the same name that is called a <em>physician, </em>to distinguish him from the other. <em>Demas</em>, of whom he makes mention, is undoubtedly the person of whom he complains — that he afterwards deserted him. (<span class="bvs">2Ti_4:10</span>.) </p></div>
