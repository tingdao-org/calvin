<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华全会众这样说，你们今日转去不跟从耶和华，干犯以色列的神，为自己筑一座坛，悖逆了耶和华，这犯的是什么罪呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Thus says the whole congregation, </em>etc Just as if it had been known that this second altar was opposed to the one only altar of God, they begin with upbraiding them, and that in a very harsh and severe manner. They thus assume it as confessed, that the two tribes had built the altar with a view of offering sacrifices upon it. In this they are mistaken, as it was destined for a different use and purpose. Moreover, had the idea which they had conceived been correct, all the expostulation which they employ would have been just; for it was a clear case of criminal revolt to make any change in the Law of God, who values obedience more than all sacrifices, (<span class="bvs">1Sa_15:22</span>) and there would have been perfect ground for condemning them as apostates, in withdrawing from the one only altar. </p></div>
