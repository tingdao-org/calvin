<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">祭司从百姓所当得的分乃是这样，凡献牛或羊为祭的，要把前腿和两腮并脾胃给祭司。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And this shall be the priests’ due. </em>It is not only for the sake of the priests that God enumerates what He would have them receive, that they may obtain what is their own without murmuring or dispute; but He also has regard to the people,lest the priests should basely and greedily take more than their due; which sacred history relates to have been done by the sons of Eli, (<span class="bvs">1Sa_2:23</span>,) for they had advanced to such a degree of licentiousness, that, like robbers, they seized violently on whatever their lust desired. Lest therefore they should give way to this gross covetousness, God prescribes to them certain limits, to which they were to confine themselves, so that if they transgressed them, it was easy for any of the people to convict them of avarice. </p></div>
