<div class="comment-content"><p>What he had already explained he now repeats for the sake of confirmation, <em>that they went upon their four sides </em>— that is, each living creature proceeded straight forward; the words <em>they turned not </em>refer to their perseverance; not that they exceeded the appointed space, but because they went forward to their object without intermission. I touch but lightly now on what has been already sufficiently explained. </p></div>
