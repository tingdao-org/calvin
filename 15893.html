<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这是耶和华所做的，在我们眼中看为希奇。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>This, </em>says he, <em>is the doing of Jehovah </em>“Go and quarrel with God, all ye that strenuously endeavor to eject me from my throne, to which I have not been elevated accidentally, or by human policy, but by the manifest power of God.” This he confirms by all being constrained to wonder at what had occurred as a thing incredible. Now, when God doeth marvellously, and in a manner that surpasses our comprehension, his power cannot fail to be so much the more apparent unto us. Should any prefer to interpret it thus:-Although this work may fill men with astonishment, yet that is no reason for rejecting it; he may do so. To me, however, it certainly appears more probable that David employs the term <em>wonderful, </em>that the haughtiness of man may submit to God, and that none may presume to breathe a whisper against him. The fitness of these things being applied to Christ will be more properly discussed when I come to consider the twenty-fifth verse. </p></div>
