<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在田野的一切军长，和属他们的人，听见巴比伦王立了亚希甘的儿子基大利作境内的省长，并将没有掳到巴比伦的男人，妇女，孩童，和境内极穷的人全交给他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Mention has been before made of Gedaliah. We have seen that the Prophet was once rescued from death through his kindness, for he interposed for him when almost all with one consent doomed the holy Prophet to death. <span class="cite-ref">(119)</span> And God bestowed on him no common honor, that while he was seeking nothing, Nebuchadnezzar should set him as governor over the land. He did not, indeed, enjoy power for any length of time; but it was yet God’s will to extend his hand to the pious man, so that he might have, at least for a time, some evidence of his favor. He was at length, as we shall see, killed by treachery. </p><p>The Prophet now tells us, that the leaders of the forces, before scattered together with their troops, were now come to him. When the Prophet says that they were <em>in the field, </em>I do not think as some, that they were those who fled when the city was taken. But probably they were those who were forced to flee from the cities at the first entrance of the Chaldean army. Nor does it seem probable that they escaped, when all the companions of the king were overtaken and caught in the plain of Jericho, as we have already seen. I then think that they were those who had been scattered here and there, having deserted the cities committed to them at the first approach of their enemies. As then they had been wanderers from their own country and exiles, they now returned to Gedaliah. By saying that the <em>leaders of the forces had heard, </em>he does not mean that they had now an army, but that they had been set over cities and towns in Judea together with their troops. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(119)</span> There is here an oversight; it was his father Ahikam that delivered the Prophet, as recorded in the twenty-sixth chapter (<span class="bvs">Jer_26:0</span>). — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
