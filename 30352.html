<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>If the Lord will</em>. A twofold condition is laid down, “If we shall live so long,” and, “If the Lord will;” because many things may intervene to upset what we may have determined; for we are blind as to all future events. <span class="cite-ref">(135)</span> By will he means not that which is expressed in the law, but God’s counsel by which he governs all things. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(135)</span> The words may be rendered thus, “If the Lord will, we shall both live and do this or that.” So that living and doing are both dependent on God’s will. </p></div></div>
