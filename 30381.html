<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">叫你们的信心既被试验，就比那被火试验，仍然能坏的金子，更显宝贵。可以在耶稣基督显现的时候，得着称赞，荣耀，尊贵。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Much more precious than of gold </em>The argument is from the less to the greater; for if gold, a corruptible metal, is deemed of so much value that we prove it by fire, that it may become really valuable, what wonder is it that God should require a similar trial as to faith, since faith is deemed by him so excellent? And though the words seem to have a different meaning, he yet compares faith to gold, and makes it more precious than gold, that hence he might draw the conclusion, that it ought to be fully proved. <span class="cite-ref">(11)</span> It is moreover uncertain how far he extends the meaning of the words, “tried” <span class="lang el-gr">δοκιμάζεσθαι</span> and “trial” <span class="lang el-gr">δοκίμιον</span></p><p>Gold is, indeed, tried twice by fire; first, when it is separated from its dross; and then, when a judgment is to be formed of its purity. Both modes of trial may very suitably be applied to faith; for when there is much of the dregs of unbelief remaining in us, and when by various afflictions we are refined as it were in God’s furnace, the dross of our faith is removed, so that it becomes pure and clean before God; and, at the same time, a trial of it is made, as to whether it be true or fictitious. I am disposed to take these two views, and what immediately follows seems to favor this explanation; for as silver is without honor or value before it be refined, so he intimates that our faith is not to be honored and crowned by God until it be duly proved. </p><p><em>At the appearing of Jesus Christ, </em>or, <em>when Jesus Christ shall be revealed</em>. This is added, that the faithful might learn to hold on courageously to the last day. For our life is now hidden in Christ, and will remain hidden, and as it were buried, until Christ shall appear from heaven; and the whole course of our life leads to the destruction of the external man, and all the things we suffer are, as it were, the preludes of death. It is hence necessary, that we should cast our own eyes on Christ, if we wish in our afflictions to behold glory and praise. For trials as to us are full of reproach and shame, and they become glorious in Christ; but that glory in Christ is not yet plainly seen, for the day of consolation is not yet come. <span class="cite-ref">(12)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(11)</span> The seeming difference in meaning referred to, arises from this, that the Apostle uses two nouns (a common thing in Scripture) instead of a noun and an adjective or participle — “the trial of your faith,” instead of “your tried faith,” or, “your faith when tried.” — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(12)</span> The “praise, honor, and glory,” refer to tried faith; it will be praised or approved by the Judge, honored before men and angels, and followed by eternal glory. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
