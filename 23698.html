<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为凡要救自己生命的，（生命或作灵魂下同）必丧掉生命。凡为我丧掉生命的，必得着生命。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>For he that would save his life shall lose it. </em>It is a most appropriate consolation, that they who willingly suffer death for the sake of Christ <span class="cite-ref">(467)</span> do actually obtain life; for Mark expressly states this as the motive to believers in dying — <em>for my sake, and for the sake of the Gospel </em>— and in the words of Matthew the same thing must be understood. It frequently happens that irreligious men are prompted by ambition or despair to despise life; and to such persons it will be no advantage that they are courageous in meeting death. The threatening, which is contrasted with the promise, has also a powerful tendency to shake off carnal sloth, when he reminds men who are desirous of the present life, that the only advantage which they reap is, to<em>lose </em>life. There is a contrast intended here between temporal and eternal death, as we have explained under <span class="bvs">Mat_10:39</span>, where the reader will find the rest of this subject. <span class="cite-ref">(468)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(467)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceux qui meurent alaigrement pour Christ</span>;” — “those who die cheerfully for Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(468)</span> Harmony, vol. 1 p. 472. </p></div></div>
