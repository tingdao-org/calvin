<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那借着律例架弄残害，在位上行奸恶的，岂能与你相交吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20</strong><em>Shall the throne of iniquities have fellowship with thee? </em>He again derives an argument for confidence from the nature of God, it being impossible that he should show favor to the wicked, or sanction their evil devices. With God for their enemy, how could they escape being destroyed? The words have greater force from being thrown into the form of a question, to show how completely opposed all sin is to the divine nature. The term <em>throne </em>is used, because those against whom the present charge is brought were not common robbers or assassins, who are universally recognized as infamous, but tyrants who persecuted the Lord’s people under color of law. These, although occupying the throne which has been consecrated to <em>God, </em>have stained and polluted it with their crimes, and therefore have nothing in common with it. The meaning is brought out more clearly in the subsequent clause of the verse, where they are declared to be persons utterly estranged from God, who <em>frame molestation for law, </em>or, as the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">חק</span>, <em>chok, </em>signifies, <em>decree of law, </em>or <em>statute order. </em>The Psalmist aims at those profligate judges who, under pretense of pursuing the strict course of office, perpetrate the worst species of enormities. Judges of this abandoned character, as we know, with no other view than to retain possession of a specious name for integrity, invent various excuses to defend their infamous oppressions. The meaning of the Psalmist is apparent then; and it is this, that honorable as a throne may be, so far as the name goes, it ceases to have any worth or estimation with God when abused by wicked men; for iniquity can never meet with his approbation. </p></div>
