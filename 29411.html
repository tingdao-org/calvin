<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为我没有别人与我同心，实在挂念你们的事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20</strong><em>I have no man like-minded</em>. While some draw another meaning from the passage, I interpret it thus: “I have no one equally well-affected for attending to your interests.” For Paul, in my opinion, compares Timothy with others, rather than with himself, and he pronounces this eulogium upon him, with the express design that he may be the more highly esteemed by them for his rare excellence. </p></div>
