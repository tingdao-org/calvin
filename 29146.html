<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们当日所夸的福气在哪里呢？那时你们若能行，就是把自己的眼睛剜出来给我，也都情愿。这是我可以给你们作见证的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Where is there your blessedness? </em>Paul had made them happy, and he intimates that the pious affection with which they formerly regarded him was an expression of their happiness. But now, by allowing themselves to be deprived of the services of him to whom they ought to have attributed whatever knowledge they possessed of Christ, they gave evidence that they were unhappy. This hint was intended to produce keen reflection. “What? Shall all this be lost? Will you forfeit all the advantage of having once heard Christ speaking by my lips? Shall the foundation in the faith which you received from me be to no purpose? Shall your falling away now destroy the glory of your obedience in the presence of God?” In short, by despising the pure doctrine which they had embraced, they throw away, of their own accord, the <em>blessedness </em>which they had obtained, and draw down upon themselves the destruction in which their unhappy career must terminate. </p><p><em>For I bear you record</em>. It is not enough that pastors be respected, if they are not also loved; for both are necessary to make the doctrine they preach be fully relished; and both, the apostle declares, had existed among the Galatians. He had already spoken of their respect for him, and he now speaks of their love. To be willing to <em>pluck out their own eyes</em>, if it had been necessary, was an evidence of very extraordinary love, stronger than the willingness to part with life. </p></div>
