<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">次日黎明，王就起来，急忙往狮子坑那里去。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the king begins to act with a little more consistency, when he approaches the pit. He was formerly struck down by fear as to yield to his nobles, and to forget his royal dignity by delivering himself up to them as a captive. But now he neither dreads their envy nor the perverseness of their discourse. <em>He approaches the lions’ den early in the morning, </em>says he, — that is, at dawn, before it was, light, coming during the twilight, <em>and in haste. </em>Thus we see him suffering under the most bitter grief, which overcomes all his former fears; for he might still have suffered from fear, through remembrance of that formidable denunciation, — Thou wilt no longer enjoy thy supreme command, unless thou dost vindicate thine edict from contempt! But, as I have said, grief overcomes all fear. And yet we are unable to praise either his piety or his humanity; because, though he approaches the cave and calls out, “Daniel!” with a lamentable voice, still he is not yet angry with his nobles till he sees the servant of God perfectly safe. Then his spirits revive, as we shall see; but as yet he persists in his weakness, and is in a middle place between the perverse despisers and the hearty worshippers of God, who follow with an upright intention what they know to be just. </p></div>
