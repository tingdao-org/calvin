<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>43.</strong><em>Murmur not among yourselves. </em>He throws back on them the blame of the <em>murmuring</em>, as if he had said, “My doctrine contains no ground of offense, but because you are reprobate, it irritates your envenomed breasts, and the reason why you do not relish it is, that you have a vitiated taste.” </p></div>
