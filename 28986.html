<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们不仗着别人所劳碌的，分外夸口。但指望你们信心增长的时候，所量给我们的界限，就可以因着你们更加开展，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>In the labors of others. </em>He now reproves more freely the false Apostles, who, while they had put forth their hand in the reaping of another man’s harvest, had the audacity at the same time to revile those, who had prepared a place for them at the expense of sweat and toil. Paul had built up the Church of the Corinthians — not without the greatest struggle, and innumerable difficulties. Those persons afterwards come forward, and find the road made and the gate open. That they may appear persons of consequence, they impudently claim for themselves what did not of right belong to them, and disparage Paul’s labors. </p><p><em>But having hope. </em>He again indirectly reproves the Corinthians, because they had stood in the way of his making greater progress in advancing the gospel. For when he says that he hopes that, when <em>their faith is increased </em>the boundaries of his glowing will be enlarged, he intimates, that the weakness of faith under which they labored was the reason, why his career had been somewhat retarded. “I ought now to have been employed in gaining over new Churches, and that too with your assistance, if you had made as much proficiency as you ought to have done; but now you retard me by your infirmity. I hope, however, that the Lord will grant, that greater progress will be made by you in future, and that in this way the glory of my ministry will be increased according to the rule of the divine calling.” <span class="cite-ref">(787)</span> To <em>glory in things that have been prepared </em>is equivalent to <em>glorying in the labors of others; </em>for, while Paul had fought the battle, <em>they </em>enjoyed the triumph. <span class="cite-ref">(788)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(787)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Selon la regle et mesure de la vocation Diuine</span>;” — “According to the rule and measure of the Divine calling.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(788)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car combien que S. Paul eust guerroye, toutesfois les autres triomphoyent; c’est t dire, combien qu’il eust soustenu tout le fais et la peine, les autres en raportoyent la gloire</span>;” — “For although Paul had fought the battle, yet others enjoyed the triumph: that is to say, though he had borne all the burden and trouble, others carried off the glory.” </p></div></div>
