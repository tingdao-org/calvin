<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And they came to Elim. </em>Moses here relates that a more pleasant station was granted to the people, when they were led to a well-watered spot, even planted with palm-trees, which do not usually grow in a dry soil. But we learn from what precedes, that this was a concession to their infirmity, because they had borne their thirst so impatiently. </p></div>
