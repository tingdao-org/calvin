<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And after this, he saith to his disciples. </em>At length he now shows that he cared about Lazarus, though the disciples thought that he had forgotten him, or, at least, that there were other matters which he reckoned of more importance than the life of Lazarus. He therefore enjoins them to cross the Jordan, and <em>go to Judea </em></p></div>
