<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣说，你们叫众人坐下。原来那地方的草多，众人就坐下。数目约有五千。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Make the men sit down. </em>That the disciples were not sooner prepared to cherish the hope which their Master held out, and did not remember to ascribe to his power all that was proper, was a degree of stupidity worthy of blame; but no small praise is due to their cheerful obedience in now complying with his injunction, though they know not what is his intention, or what advantage they will derive from what they are doing. The same readiness to obey is manifested by the people; for, while they are uncertain about the result, they all sit down as soon as a single word of command has been pronounced. And this is the trial of true faith, when God commands men to walk, as it were, in darkness. For this purpose let us learn not to be wise in ourselves, but, amidst great confusion, still to hope for a prosperous issue, when we follow the guidance of God, who never disappoints his own people. </p></div>
