<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为耶和华已经把又大又强的国民从你们面前赶出。直到今日，没有一人在你们面前站立得住。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>For the Lord has driven out from before you, </em>etc He intimates that so long as they do not themselves change, there will certainly be no change on the part of God. Therefore he asserts that, provided they conciliate the favor of God, they shall have an uninterrupted course of victory. At length he again exhorts them, as they value their life and safety, to be careful in maintaining love to God. From this source all true obedience springs; for if we do not cling to him with free and ardent affection, we shall study in vain to frame our lives in accordance with the external form of the Law. </p></div>
