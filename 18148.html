<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">妇人怀孕，临产疼痛，在痛苦之中喊叫，耶和华阿，我们在你面前，也是如此。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>As a woman with child. </em>Here two things ought chiefly to be remarked. First, he compares believers to women in labor, who, we know, endure exquisite pain; and, accordingly, he says that their anguish breaks out into loud and violent cries. Hence we infer that the Prophet does not only speak of that sorrow which arises from outward distresses and annoyances, but rather describes that dreadful anguish by which the hearts of the godly are sorely and dreadfully tormented, when they perceive that God is angry with them, and when their consciences reprove them. There is no bodily pain so acute that it can be compared to that anguish, and this is plainly expressed by the phrase <em>in thy sight </em></p></div>
