<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>For the laborer is worthy of his food. </em>Christ anticipates an objection that might be made: for it might appear to be a harsh condition to travel through the whole of Judea without any provisions. <span class="cite-ref">(576)</span> Accordingly, Christ tells them, that they have no reason to dread that they will suffer hunger; because, wherever they come, they will at least be <em>worthy of their food </em><span class="cite-ref">(577)</span> He calls them <em>laborers, </em>not that they resembled ordinary ministers, who labor in the Lord’s vineyard, and who, by planting and watering, bring it into a state of cultivation; but merely because they were the heralds of a richer and more complete doctrine. They did not at that time receive the office of preaching any farther than to render the Jews attentive to the preaching of the Gospel. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(576)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">N'ayans rien de quoy faire leurs despens</span>;” — “having no means of paying their expenses.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(577)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils gaigneront bien pour le moins leur nourriture</span>;” — “they will get their food at least.” </p></div></div>
