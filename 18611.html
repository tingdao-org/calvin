<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Therefore shall evil come upon thee. </em>Continuing the subject which he had formerly introduced, he ridicules the foolish confidence of the Babylonians, who thought that by the position of the stars they foresaw all events. He therefore says that they shall soon be overtaken by that which Scripture threatens generally against all despisers of God, (<span class="bvs">1Th_5:3</span>,) that, “when they shall say, Peace and safety, sudden destruction shall overwhelm them,” and that at the dawning of the day they shall not know what shall be accomplished in the evening; and it, is very clear from the book of Daniel that this happened. (<span class="bvs">Dan_5:30</span>.) </p></div>
