<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们既然在信心，口才，知识，热心，和待我们的爱心上，都格外显出满足来，就当在这慈惠的事上，也格外显出满足来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>But as </em>He had already been very careful to avoid giving offense, inasmuch as he said, that Titus had entreated them, not so much from his own inclination, as in consideration of the charge given him by the Macedonians. Now, however, he goes a step farther, by admonishing them, that they must not even wait for the message of the Macedonians being communicated to them; and that too, by commending their other virtues. “You ought not merely to associate yourselves as partners with the Macedonians, who require that; but surpass them in this respect, too, as you do in others.” </p><p>He makes a distinction between<em>utterance </em>and <em>faith, </em>because it. is impossible that any one should have <em>faith, </em>and that, too, in an eminent degree, without being at the same time much exercised in the word of God. <em>Knowledge </em>I understand to mean, <em>practice </em>and <em>skill, </em>or <em>prudence. </em>He makes mention of their <em>love </em>to himself, that he may encourage them also from regard to himself personally, and in the mean time he gives up, with a view to the public advantage of the brethren, the personal affection with which they regarded him. <span class="cite-ref">(668)</span> Now in this way he lays a restraint upon himself in everything, that he may not seem to accuse them when exhorting them. </p><p><strong>(668)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De laquelle les Corinthiens l’aimoyent et ses compagnons</span>;” “With which the Corinthians loved him and his associates.” </p></div>
