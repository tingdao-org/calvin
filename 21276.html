<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们不得与那未受割礼仆倒的勇士一同躺卧。这些勇士带着兵器下阴间，头枕刀剑，骨头上有本身的罪孽。他们曾在活人之地使勇士惊恐。</div></div>
