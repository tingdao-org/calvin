<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这些事我既从起头都详细考察了，就定意要按着次序写给你，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Having carefully examined all things </em>The old translator has it, <em>having followed out all things; </em><span class="cite-ref">(20)</span> and the Greek verb <span class="lang el-gr">παρακολουθεῖν</span> is taken metaphorically from those who tread in the footsteps of others, that nothing may escape them. So that Luke intended to express his close and laborious investigation, just as Demosthenes employs the same word, when, in examining an embassy against which he brings an accusation, he boasts of his diligence to have been such, that he perceived every thing that had been done as well as if he had been a spectator. </p><p><strong>(20)</strong>Omnia assequuto. </p></div>
