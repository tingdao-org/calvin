<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">主人就大怒，把他交给掌刑的，等他还清了所欠的债。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that he owed. </em>The Papists are very ridiculous in endeavoring to light the fire of purgatory by the word <em>till</em>; for it is certain that Christ here points out not temporal death, by which the judgment of God may be satisfied, but eternal death. </p></div>
