<div class="CUV verse">因为他知道我们的本体，思念我们不过是尘土。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>For he knoweth </em>David here annihilates all the worth which men would arrogate to themselves, and asserts that it is the consideration of our misery, and that alone, which moves God to exercise patience towards us. This again we ought carefully to mark, not only for the purpose of subduing the pride of our flesh, but also that a sense of our unworthiness may not prevent us from trusting in God. The more wretched and despicable our condition is, the more inclined is God to show mercy, for the remembrance that we are clay and dust is enough to incite him to do us good. </p></div>
