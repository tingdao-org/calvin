<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">便雅悯人也出来迎敌，就被引诱离城。在田间两条路上，一通伯特利，一通基比亚，像前两次，动手杀死以色列人约有三十个。</div></div>
