<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在以色列高处的山栽上。它就生枝子，结果子，成为佳美的香柏树，各类飞鸟都必宿在其下，就是宿在枝子的荫下。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>When God announces <em>that the twig which he will plant shall become a lofty cedar, </em>he shows by lofty words that the increase of Christ’s kingdom shall be so wonderful, that it shall surpass the common rule of nature; which indeed was shadowed forth in the person of Zerubbabel, who was chosen to bring back the people from their sad and disgraceful captivity. (<span class="bvs">Ezr_2:2</span>; <span class="bvs">Hag_1:14</span>.) For it does not naturally happen that a twig increases in a short time to a lofty cedar, for we know how slowly cedars grow, and hence we see the Spirit’s intention in saying that a tree should spring from a very small twig. And this prophecy answers to one of Isaiah’s, where he says, (<span class="bvs">Isa_11:1</span>,) A branch shall spring from the root of Jesse: for the house of Jesse was cut off, and he names the house of an obscure and private man as if the remembrance of David were utterly lost. The house of Jesse then was cut off like a tree: that twig, says he, shall spring from its root. Now the Prophet signifies the same thing, and almost under the same similitude. I leave the rest for the next lecture. </p></div>
