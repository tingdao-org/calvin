<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">于是，以色列人在拿弗他利山地分定加利利的基低斯。在以法莲山地分定示剑。在犹大山地分定基列亚巴（基列亚巴就是希伯仑）。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And they appointed Kedesh, </em>etc The Hebrew word Kedesh here used, signifies also to fit and consecrate. Accordingly, I interpret, that cities were selected according as common use required. <span class="cite-ref">(174)</span> Hence it is inferred that matters were well arranged so as to make private yield to public interest. Moreover, we shall see in the next chapter, that Ciriath-Arbah, which was afterwards called Hebron, was transferred to the Levites, though it had formerly been the property of Caleb. Hence appeared the rare, nay, the incomparable moderation of this aged saint, who readily gave up to others both the city and suburbs, which he had justly claimed as his right, the moment the lot showed that this was pleasing to God. It was necessary to advert briefly to this change, because the Lord was pleased that asylums should be found only in the Levitical cities, that their innocence might be defended with greater fidelity and authority. </p><p><strong>(174)</strong> Latin, “Prout communis usus ferebat.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Selon que le profit et l’utilite commune le requeroit</span>;” “According as the common profit and utility required.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
