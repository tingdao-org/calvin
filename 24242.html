<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">污鬼叫那人抽了一阵疯，大声喊叫，就出来了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_1:26</span><em>When the unclean spirit had torn him </em>Luke uses a milder phrase, <em>when the devil had thrown him down: </em>but they agree perfectly as to the meaning; for the design of both was to show, that the devil went out of the man in a violent manner. He threw down the unhappy man, as if he had intended to tear him: but Luke says that the attempt was unsuccessful; for <em>he hurt him nothing </em>Not that the attack was, in no degree whatever, attended by injury, or at least by some feeling of pain; but that the man was afterwards delivered from the devil, and restored to perfect health. </p></div>
