<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶户献完了燔祭，就出来吩咐护卫兵和众军长说，你们进去杀他们，不容一人出来。护卫兵和军长就用刀杀他们，将尸首抛出去，便到巴力庙的城去了，</div></div>
