<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华向来眷念我们。他还要赐福给我们，要赐福给以色列的家，赐福给亚伦的家。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>Jehovah hath remembered us </em>Many render the term <em>bless </em>in the past tense, <em>he has blessed, </em>it being the design of the prophet, according to them, to propose the past experience of God’s kindness as an encouragement to cherish good hope for the future: “We have already, from long experience, been taught how valuable the favor of our God is, because from this source alone have flowed our prosperity, our abundance, and our stability.” He assumes the principle, the truth of which ought to be admitted by all, that we neither enjoy prosperity nor happiness further than it pleases God to bless us. As often as the Israelites were rescued from manifold dangers, or succored in time of need, or treated in a friendly manner, so many palpable proofs had they of the loving-kindness of God towards them. As, however, there is no just cause to urge us to change the verb from the future into the past tense, it is quite in unison with the scope of the passage, if we say that the same blessing is here promised to the faithful which they have formerly realized. Thus the meaning will be, that God, mindful of his covenant, has hitherto been attentive to us; therefore, as he has begun to favor us, he will continue to do so for ever. In pronouncing these blessings, he observes the same order as above, assigning to the children of Aaron a superior place in God’s benediction, excluding from it those among the Israelites who were hypocrites. </p></div>
