<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华说，我岂不因这些事讨罪呢？岂不报复这样的国民呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He repeats what we have before noticed, so there is no need of an explanation. But the repetition is not without its use; for the Jews had become so torpid, that all reproofs and threatenings were regarded with indifference. Hence God rouses them with great vehemence, <em>Shall I not, </em>he says, <em>visit for these things? </em>He takes it for granted, that we ought to be fully persuaded, that he is the judge of the world. It is the proper office of a judge to punish the wicked, and also to relieve the helpless and the oppressed, and to check the audacity of those who allow themselves every liberty. God then reasons here from his own nature and office, as though he had said, “Since I am God, can I suffer so much impiety and wantonness to prevail unpunished among my people?” Then he adds — </p><p>On such a nation as this, shall not avenged be my soul? </p><p>God transfers here to himself, as we have said elsewhere, what does not strictly belong to him; but it is the same as though he had said, “There is no one among earthly judges so void of feeling as to bear such indignities; for when the judge sees that he is treated with contempt by the wicked, is he not provoked?” <em>Avenged then shall be my soul; </em>as though he said, that he is not so soft, or so slothful, or so careless, as not to take vengeance on such wanton contempt. It follows — </p></div>
