<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">弟兄们，你们蒙召，是要得自由。只是不可将你们的自由当作放纵情欲的机会。总要用爱心互相服事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Ye have been called to liberty</em>. He now proceeds to show in what way liberty must be used. In the course of expounding the First Epistle to the Corinthians, we have pointed out that liberty is one thing, and that the use of it is another thing. Liberty lies in the conscience, and looks to God; the use of it lies in outward matters, and deals not with God only, but with men. Having exhorted the Galatians to suffer no diminution of their liberty, he now enjoins them to be moderate in the use of it, and lays down as a rule for the lawful use, that it shall not be turned into pretext or occasion for licentiousness. Liberty is not granted to the flesh, which ought rather to be held captive under the yoke, but is a spiritual benefit, which none but pious minds are capable of enjoying. </p><p><em>But by love</em>. The method here explained of restraining liberty from breaking out into wide and licentious abuse is, to have it regulated <em>by love</em>. Let us always remember that the present question is not, in what manner we are free before God, but in what manner we may use our liberty in our intercourse with men. A good conscience submits to no slavery; but to practice outward slavery, or to abstain from the use of liberty, is attended by no danger. In a word, if “by love we serve one another,” we shall always have regard to edification, so that we shall not grow wanton, but use the grace of God for his honor and the salvation of our neighbors. </p></div>
