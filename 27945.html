<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>I am therefore ready</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(37)</span><em>etc. </em>He concludes what he had before said of his desire — that as he knew it to be his duty to spread the gospel among them, in order to gather fruit for the Lord, he was anxious to fulfill God’s calling, as far as he was allowed to do so by the Lord. </p><p><strong>(37)</strong><span class="lang el-gr">τὸ κατ ἐμὲ πρόθυμον, </span> literally, “As to me <em>there </em>is readiness;” or, according to [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] “<em>There </em>is a readiness so far as it respects me.” But, “I am ready,” or “I am prepared,” conveys the meaning sufficiently, without the other words, “As much as in me is.” By saying that <em>he </em>was prepared, he intimates that the event depended on another, even on God. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
