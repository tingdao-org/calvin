<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若有误行，是会众所不知道的，后来全会众就要将一只公牛犊作燔祭，并照典章把素祭和奠祭一同献给耶和华为馨香之祭，又献一只公山羊作赎罪祭。</div></div>
