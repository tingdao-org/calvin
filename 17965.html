<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">希实本和以利亚利悲哀的声音，达到雅杂。所以摩押带兵器的高声喊嚷。人心战兢。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh. </em>Here he names other cities; for his design is to bind up, as it were, in a bundle all the cities of that country, that they may be involved in the general destruction; as if he had said, that none at all shall be exempted. </p><p><em>Therefore the light-armed soldiers of Moab shall howl</em>. Though <span class="lang he-il">על כן</span> (<em>gnal ken</em>) literally signifies <em>therefore</em>, yet some think that a reason is not here assigned; but that is of little importance. The Prophet shows that there will be none that does not <em>howl</em>; for he declares that the bold and courageous shall mourn. Next he adds, <em>the soul of every one shall howl to him. </em><span class="cite-ref">(241)</span> Every one shall be so engrossed with his own grief, that he will not think of his neighbors. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(241)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
