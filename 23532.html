<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当审判的时候，南方的女王，要起来定这世代的罪，因为她从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧话。看哪，在这里有一人比所罗门更大。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42.</strong><em>The queen of the south. </em>As Ethiopia lies in a southerly direction from Judea, I willingly concur with Josephus and other writers, who assert that she was the queen of Ethiopia. In sacred history she is called <em>the queen of Sheba, </em>(<span class="bvs">2Ch_9:1</span>.) We must not suppose this <em>Sheba </em>to be the country of <em>Saba, </em>which rather lay toward the east, but a town situated in Meroe, an island on the Nile, which was the metropolis of the kingdom. Here, too, we must attend to the points of contrast. A woman who had not been at all educated in the school of God, was induced, by the desire of instruction, to come from a distant region to Solomon, an earthly king; while the Jews, who had been instructed in the divine law, reject their highest and only teacher, the Prince of all the prophets. The word <em>condemn </em>relates not to the persons, but to the fact itself, and the example which it yields. </p></div>
