<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">其中的祭司强解我的律法，亵渎我的圣物，不分别圣的和俗的，也不使人分辨洁净的和不洁净的，又遮眼不顾我的安息日。我也在他们中间被亵慢。</div></div>
