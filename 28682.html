<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>He that speaketh in another tongue, edifieth himself. In </em>place of what he had said before — that he <em>speaketh unto God, </em>he now says — he <em>speaketh to himself </em>But whatever is done in the Church, ought to be for the common benefit. Away, then, with that <em>misdirected </em>ambition, which gives occasion for the advantage of the people generally being hindered! Besides, Paul speaks by way of concession: for when ambition makes use of such empty vauntings, <span class="cite-ref">(811)</span> there is inwardly no desire of doing good; but Paul does, in effect, order away from the common society of believers those men of mere show, who look only to themselves. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(811)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Iettent ainsi de grandes bouffees et se brauent en leur parler</span>;” — “Make use in this way of great puffings, and boast themselves in their talk.” </p></div></div>
