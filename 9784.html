<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">犹大王亚哈谢见这光景，就从园亭之路逃跑。耶户追赶他，说，把这人也杀在车上。到了靠近以伯莲姑珥的坡上击伤了他。他逃到米吉多，就死在那里。</div></div>
