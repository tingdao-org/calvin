<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">看见路旁有一棵无花果树，就走到跟前，在树上找不着什么，不过有叶子。就对树说，从今以后，你永不结果子。那无花果树就立刻枯干了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19</strong><em>Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth. </em>Let us learn from this what is the meaning of the word <em>curse, </em>namely, that the tree should be condemned to barrenness; as, on the other hand, God <em>blesses, </em>when by his voice he bestows fertility. It appears more clearly from Mark <em>, </em>that the fig-tree did not instantly wither, or, at least, that it was not observed by his disciples, until they saw it next day stripped of <em>leaves. </em>Mark <em>, </em>too, attributes to <em>Peter </em>what Matthew attributes equally to all the disciples; but as Christ replies in the plural number, it may naturally be inferred that one put the question in the name of all. </p></div>
