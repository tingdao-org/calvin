<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah. </em>It was requisite that some memorial of so great a sin should exist, that the sons might not imitate their fathers. Heretofore God had sustained them with a food both agreeable and wholesome: by longing for unlawful nourishment they were their own poisoners and murderers. Now, such ingratitude was deservedly to be detested by their posterity; and therefore the name was given to the place, not without the inspiration of the Spirit of God. So Paul reminds us, that in this narrative God’s judgment against corrupt and vicious lusts was portrayed, that we might ourselves learn not to lust. (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:6</span>.) I have already briefly explained how far our appetites are to be restrained, and what intemperance, properly speaking, is. </p></div>
