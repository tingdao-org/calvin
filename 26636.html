<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">挨到西门彼得，彼得对他说，主阿，你洗我的脚吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Lord, dost thou wash my feet? </em>This speech expresses strong dislike of the action as foolish and unsuitable; for by asking what Christ is doing, he puts out his hand, as it were, to push him back. The modesty would be worthy of commendation, were it not that obedience is of greater value in the sight of God than any kind of honor or service, or rather, if this were not the true and only rule of humility, to yield ourselves in obedience to God, and to have all our senses regulated by his good pleasure, so that every thing which he declares to be agreeable to Him shall also be approved by us, without any scruple. We ought, therefore, above all, to observe this rule of serving God, that we shall be always ready to acquiesce, without delay, as soon as he issues any command. </p></div>
