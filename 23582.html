<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">丢在火炉里。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42.</strong><em>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire. </em>This is a metaphorical expression; for, as the infinite glory which is laid up for the sons of God so far exceeds all our senses, that we cannot find words to express it, so the punishment which awaits the reprobate is incomprehensible, and is therefore shadowed out according to the measure of our capacity. From ignorance of this, the Sophists have tortured themselves, to no purpose, by fruitless disputes, as we have already hinted on a former occasion. <span class="cite-ref">(217)</span> Some commentators, I am aware, carry their ingenious inquiries into every minute phrase; but as there is reason to fear that subtleties, which rest on no solid grounds, may lead us into idle fooleries, I choose to philosophize more sparingly, and to rest satisfied with the plain and natural meaning. If we put a question to those who are so delighted with matters of curiosity, how it comes about that, while Christ is <em>asleep, </em>and unacquainted with the affair, the devil sows tares among the good seed, they will have nothing to reply; but while I desire to exercise caution, I have endeavored to leave out nothing that is useful and necessary to be known. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span> Harmony, volume 1 p. 200. </p></div></div>
