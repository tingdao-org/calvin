<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">谨守贞洁，料理家务，待人有恩，顺服自己的丈夫，免得神的道理被毁谤。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>When he adds, <em>that the word of God may not be evil spoken of</em>, it is supposed that this relates strictly to women who were married to unbelieving husbands, who might judge of the gospel from the wicked conduct of their wives; and this appears to be confirmed by <span class="bvs">1Pe_3:1</span>. But what if he does not speak of husbands alone? And, indeed, it is probable that he demands such strictness of life as not to bring the gospel into the contempt of the public by their vices. As to the other parts of the verse, the reader will find them explained in the Commentary on the First Epistle to Timothy. <span class="cite-ref">(241)</span></p><p><strong>(241)</strong> See p. 135. </p></div>
