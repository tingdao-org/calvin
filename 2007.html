<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">摩西迎接他的岳父，向他下拜，与他亲嘴，彼此问安，都进了帐棚。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And Moses went out. </em>In the foregoing verse he had related what happened last, viz., that Jethro said, I am come, and have brought to thee thy wife and children; but this transposition is common in Hebrew. Now, then, he adds, that Moses went to meet him, and to pay him honor; and that they met each other with mutual kindness, and respectively performed the duties of affection. “To ask each other of their peace,” <span class="cite-ref">(196)</span> is tantamount to inquiring whether things were well and prospering. But the main point is, that Moses told him how gracious God had been to His people; for this was the drift of the whole of his address, that, when he had left his father-in-law, he had not yielded to the impulse of lightness, but had obeyed the call of God, as had afterwards been proved by His extraordinary aids and by heavenly prodigies. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> So in margin <em>A. V. </em></p></div></div>
