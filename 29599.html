<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们在神面前，因着你们甚是喜乐，为这一切喜乐，可用何等的感谢，为你们报答神呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>For what thanksgiving</em>. Not satisfied with a simple affirmation, he intimates how extraordinary is the greatness of his joy, by asking himself <em>what thanks he can render to God; </em>for by speaking thus he declares that he cannot find an expression of gratitude that can come up to the measure of his joy. He says that he rejoices <em>before God</em>, that is, truly and without any pretense. </p></div>
