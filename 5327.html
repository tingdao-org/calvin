<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在耶和华你神所赐你的地上，无论哪一座城里，你弟兄中若有一个穷人，你不可忍着心，？？着手不帮补你穷乏的弟兄。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>If there be among you a poor man </em>The same word <span class="lang he-il">אביון</span>, <em>ebyon</em>, is used, which we have seen just above, verse 4; nor is there any contradiction when He commands them to relieve beggars, whom He had before forbidden to exist among His people; for the object of the prohibition was, that if any were reduced to beggary, they should not be cast out and forsaken. Now, however, He explains the mode of preventing this, viz., that the hands of the rich should be open to assist them. In order to incline them to compassion, he again reminds them of their common brotherhood, and sets before them, as its token and pledge, the land in which by God’s goodness they dwell together. Again, that they may be willing and prompt in their humanity, He forbids them to harden their heart, thereby signifying that avarice is always cruel. Finally, He applies this instruction to the year of release, viz., that they should straightway relieve their poor brethren towards the beginning of that year, just as if they would receive back in a few days the money which the poor man would retain to its end. </p></div>
