<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当那日必有许多人对我说，主阿，主阿，我们不是奉你的名传道，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Many will say to me </em>Christ again summons hypocrites to his judgment-seat, as we showed a little ago from Luke. So long as they hold a place in his Church, they both flatter themselves and deceive others. He therefore declares, that a day is coming, when he will cleanse his barn, and separate the chaff and straw from the pure wheat. <em>To prophesy in the name of Christ </em>is, to discharge the office of teacher by his authority, and, as it were, under his direction. <em>Prophecy </em>is here, I think, taken in a large sense, as in the fourteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Corinthians. He might have simply used the word <em>preach, </em>but purposely employed the more honorable appellation, in order to show more clearly, that an outward profession is nothing, whatever may be its brilliancy in the eyes of men. <em>To do wonderful works in the name of Christ </em>is nothing else than to perform miracles by his power, authority, command, and direction: for, though the word <span class="lang el-gr">ὁμολογήσω</span>, <em>powers, </em>is sometimes confined to one class of miracles, yet in this and many other passages it denotes every kind of miracles. </p></div>
