<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他回答说，有一个人名叫耶稣。他和泥抹我的眼睛，对我说，你往西罗亚池子去洗。我去一洗，就看见了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And after I had gone and washed. </em>So happy a result of obedience warns us to surmount every obstacle, and to proceed courageously wherever the Lord calls us, and not even to entertain a doubt that every thing which we undertake by his authority, and under his guidance, will have a prosperous issue. </p></div>
