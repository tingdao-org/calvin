By proclaiming in magnificent terms his steadfastness, he meant to provide against the Philippians supposing that he had given way under the pressure of want. <span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> He now takes care that it may not, from his speaking in high terms, appear as though he despised their kindness — a thing that would not merely shew cruelty and obstinacy, but also haughtiness. He at the same time provides for this, that if any other of the servants of Christ should stand in need of their assistance they may not be slow to give him help. </p><p><strong>(250)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il fust abbattu, et eust perdu courage estant en indigence</span>;” — “That he had been overcome, and had lost heart, being in poverty.” </p></div>
