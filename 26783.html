<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">父阿，我在哪里，愿你所赐给我的人也同我在哪里，叫他们看见你所赐给我的荣耀。因为创立世界以前，你已经爱我了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Father, I will. To will </em>is put for <em>to desire; </em><span class="cite-ref">(129)</span> for it expresses not a command but a prayer. But it may be understood in two ways; either that <em>he wills </em>that the disciples may enjoy his eternal presence, or, that God <em>may, </em>at length, receive them into the heavenly kingdom, to which he goes before them. </p><p><em>That they may behold my glory. </em>Some explain <em>beholding his glory </em>to mean, partaking of <em>the glory </em>which Christ has. Others explain it to be, to know by the experience of faith what Christ is, and how great is his majesty. For my own part, after carefully weighing the whole matter, I think that Christ speaks of the perfect happiness of believers, as if he had said, that his desire will not be satisfied till they have been received into heaven. In the same manner I explain the Beholding of the <em>glory. </em>At that time they saw the <em>glory </em>of Christ, just as a man shut up in the dark obtains, through small chinks, a feeble and glimmering light. Christ now wishes that they shall make such progress as to enjoy the full brightness of heaven. In short, he asks that the Father will conduct them, by uninterrupted progress, to the full vision of his <em>glory. </em></p><p><em>For thou lovedst me. </em>This also agrees better with the person of the Mediator than with Christ’s Divinity alone. It would be harsh to say that the Father loved his Wisdom; and though we were to admit it, the connection of the passage leads us to a different view. Christ, unquestionably, spoke as the Head of the Church, when he formerly prayed that the apostles might be united with him, and might <em>behold the glory </em>of his reign. He now says that the love of the Father is the cause of it; and, therefore, it follows that he was <em>beloved, </em>in so far as he was appointed to be the Redeemer of the world. With such a love did the Father love him<em>before the creation of the world, </em>that he might be the person in whom the Father would love his elect. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(129)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand il dit, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Je veux, </em><span class="lang fr-fr">c’est comme s’il disoit, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">Je desire </em><em>; </em>” — “When he says, I <em>will, </em>it is as if’ he had said, I <em>desire.” </em></p></div></div>
