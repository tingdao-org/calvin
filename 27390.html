<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">虽然查不出他有当死的罪来，还是求彼拉多杀他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>When as they found no cause of death. </em>It was very pertinent to the matter that they should know that Christ was put to death guiltless, for we could not have been justified by his death, if he had suffered death for his own evil deeds; therefore it was requisite that he should be guiltless, that his death might be a satisfaction for the sins of the world. And, undoubtedly, I think that Paul did plainly declare that Pilate condemned Christ, not according to the office of a judge, but that he consented that he should be put to death after that he was overcome with the ungodly requests of the people; and also that the Jews were driven by lust, and not enforced by reason, to desire Christ’s death.: For it stood him upon to terrify the hearers, that they might not couple themselves <span class="cite-ref">(809)</span> to so wicked a fact. But Luke doth now in few words set down, after his common custom, those things which Paul did then more at large declare. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(809)</span> “Se adjungerent socios,” join themselves as associates. </p></div></div>
