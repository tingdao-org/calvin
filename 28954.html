<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>On account of the great confidence. </em>The meaning is, “I am not afraid of their coming to you proving vain and fruitless; for I have felt beforehand an assured confidence, that their embassy will have a happy issue; I am so well aware of their fidelity and diligence.” He says that the brother, whose name he does not mention, had felt more eagerly inclined; partly because he saw that he <span class="cite-ref">(700)</span> had a good opinion of the Corinthians, partly because he had been encouraged by Titus, and partly because he saw many distinguished men apply themselves to the same business with united efforts. Hence one thing only remained — that the Corinthians themselves should not be wanting on their part. <span class="cite-ref">(701)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(700)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sainct Paul</span>;” — “St. Paul.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(701)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que les Corinthiens auisassent a ne defailler point de faire leur deuoir de leur coste</span>;” — “That the Corinthians should take care not to fail of doing their duty on their part.” </p></div></div>
