<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为他爱我们的百姓，给我们建造会堂。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_7:5</span><strong>.</strong><em>For he loveth our nation </em>This was, no doubt, a commendation given him by the Jews on account of his piety: <span class="cite-ref">(501)</span> for his <em>love of a nation </em>universally hated could proceed only from zeal for the Law, and from reverence for God. By <em>building a synagogue, </em>he showed plainly that he favored the doctrine of the Law. The Jews had therefore good grounds for saying that, as a devout worshipper of God, he had claims on Christ for receiving such a favor. They discover, at the same time, a marvellous stupidity in admitting, by their own acknowledgment, that a Gentile possesses that grace of God which they despise and reject. If they consider Christ to be the minister and dispenser of the gifts of God, why do they not receive the grace offered to them before bringing foreigners to enjoy it? But hypocrites never fail to manifest such carelessness and presumption, as not to hesitate to look upon God as under some sort of obligations to them, and to dispose of his grace at their pleasure, as if it were in their own power; and then, when they are satisfied with it, or rather because they do not deign to taste it, they treat it as useless, and leave it to others. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(501)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il n’ y a point de doute que les Juifs recommandent cest homme pour l'affection et le bon zele qu'il avoit a la crainte de Dieu</span>.” — “There is no doubt that the Jews recommend this man for the affection and the good zeal which he had for the fear of God.” </p></div></div>
