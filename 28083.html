<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这却怎么样呢？我们在恩典之下，不在律法之下，就可以犯罪吗？断乎不可。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>What then? </em>As the wisdom of the flesh is ever clamorous against the mysteries of God, it was necessary for the Apostle to subjoin what might anticipate an objection: for since the law is the rule of life, and has been given to guide men, we think that when it is removed all discipline immediately falls to the ground, that restraints are taken away, in a word, that there remains no distinction or difference between good and evil. But we are much deceived if we think, that the righteousness which God approves of in his law is abolished, when the law is abrogated; for the abrogation is by no means to be applied to the precepts which teach the right way of living, as Christ confirms and sanctions these and does not abrogate them; but the right view is, that nothing is taken away but the curse, to which all men without grace are subject. But though Paul does not distinctly express this, yet he indirectly intimates it. </p></div>
