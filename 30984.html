<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你所看见的兽，先前有，如今没有。将要从无底坑里上来，又要归于沉沦。凡住在地上名字从创世以来没有记在生命册上的，见先前有，如今没有，以后再有的兽，就必希奇。</div></div>
