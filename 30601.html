<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并且我们一切所求的，就从他得着。因为我们遵守他的命令，行他所喜悦的事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22</strong><em>And whatsoever we ask </em>These two things are connected, <em>confidence </em>and <em>prayer</em>. As before he shewed that an evil conscience is inconsistent with confidence, so now he declares that none can really pray to God but those who with a pure heart, fear and rightly worship him. The latter follows from the former. It is a general truth taught in Scripture, that the ungodly are not heard by God, but that on the contrary, their sacrifices and prayers are an abomination to him. Hence the door is here closed up against hypocrites, lest they should in contempt of him rush into his presence. </p><p>He does not yet mean that a good conscience must be brought, as though it obtained favor to our prayers. Woe to us if we look on works, which have nothing in them but what is a cause of fear and trembling. The faithful, then, cannot otherwise come to God’s tribunal than by relying on Christ the Mediator. But as the love of God is ever connected with faith, the Apostle, in order that he might the more severely reprove hypocrites, deprives them of that singular privilege with which God favors his own children; that is, lest they should think that their prayers have an access to God. </p><p>By saying, <em>because we keep his commandments</em>, he means not that confidence in prayer is founded on our works; but he teaches this only, that true religion and the sincere worship of God cannot be separated from faith. Nor ought it to appear strange that he uses a causal particle, though he does not speak of a cause; for an inseparable addition is sometimes mentioned as a cause as when one says, Because the sun shines over us at midday, there is more heat; but it does not follow that heat comes from light. </p></div>
