<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_9:51</span><strong>.</strong><em>While the days of his being received up, etc. </em>Luke alone relates this narrative, which, however, is highly useful on many accounts. For, first, it describes the divine courage and firmness of Christ <span class="cite-ref">(586)</span> in despising death; secondly, what deadly enmities are produced by differences about religion; thirdly, with what headlong ardor the nature of man is hurried on to impatience; next, how ready we are to fall into mistakes in imitating the saints; and, lastly, by the example of Christ we are called to the exercise of meekness. The death of Christ is called his <em>being received up, </em>( <span class="lang el-gr">ἀνάληψις</span>) not only because he was then withdrawn from the midst of us, <span class="cite-ref">(587)</span> but because, leaving the mean prison of the flesh, he ascended on high. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(586)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La magnanimite et constance admirable de Iesus Christ</span>;” — “the wonderful magnanimity and firmness of Jesus Christ.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(587)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Non pas seulement pource qu il a lors este enleve et comme retranche du milieu des hommes</span>;” — “not only because he was then raised up, and, as it were, withdrawn from the midst of men.” </p></div></div>
