<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">赐平安的神，快要将撒但践踏在你们脚下。愿我主耶稣基督的恩，常和你们同在。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong>What follows, <em>God shall bruise Satan, etc.</em>, is a promise to confirm them, rather than a prayer. He indeed exhorts them to fight manfully against Satan, and promises that they should shortly be victorious. He was indeed once conquered by Christ, but not in such a way but that he renews the war continually. He then promises ultimate defeat, which does not appear in the midst of the contest. At the same time he does not speak only of the last day, when Satan shall be completely bruised; but as Satan was then confounding all things, raging, as it were, with loose or broken reins, he promises that the Lord would shortly subdue him, and cause him to be trodden, as it were, under foot. Immediately a prayer follows, — that the grace of Christ would be with them, that is, that they might enjoy all the blessings which had been procured for them by Christ. </p></div>
