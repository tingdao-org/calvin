<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">将近城门，有一个死人被抬出来。这人是他母亲独生的儿子，他母亲又是寡妇。有城里的许多人同着寡妇送殡。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>The only son of his mother. </em>The reason which induced Christ to restore the young man to life was, that he saw the <em>widow </em>bereft of her <em>only son, </em>and had compassion on her: for he did not withhold his favor till some one requested it, as he did on other occasions; but anticipated the prayers of all, and <em>restored the son to his mother, </em>by whom nothing of this sort was expected. We have here a striking emblem of his freely bestowed compassion in raising us from death to life. <em>By touching the coffin </em>he intended perhaps to show, that he would by no means shrink from death and the grave, in order to obtain life for us. He not only deigns to touch us with his hand, in order to quicken us when we are dead, but, in order that he might raise us to heaven, himself descends into the grave. </p></div>
