<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">与喜乐的人要同乐。与哀哭的人要同哭。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Rejoice with those who rejoice, etc. </em>A general truth is in the third place laid down, — that the faithful, regarding each other with mutual affection, are to consider the condition of others as their own. He first specifies two particular things, — That they were to “rejoicewith the joyful, and to weep with the weeping.” For such is the nature of true love, that one prefers to weep with his brother, rather than to look at a distance on his grief, and to live in pleasure or ease. What is meant then is, — that we, as much as possible, ought to sympathize with one another, and that, whatever our lot may be, each should transfer to himself the feeling of another, whether of grief in adversity, or of joy in prosperity. And, doubtless, not to regard with joy the happiness of a brother is envy; and not to grieve for his misfortunes is inhumanity. Let there be such a sympathy among us as may at the same time adapt us to all kinds of feelings. </p></div>
