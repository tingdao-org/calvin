<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">希西家王的臣仆，就去见以赛亚，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. </em>As the Prophet formerly related that the pious king had no other refuge than to consult the mouth of the Lord, so he now shews that he did not consult in vain; for he received the consolation which he desired. Instructed by this example, if we seek relief from him by pouring our cares and anxieties into the bosom of God, our hope shall never be disappointed; and although there will not always be prophets in the world, such as Isaiah was, yet he will come forth seasonably to render assistance in an appropriate manner. </p></div>
