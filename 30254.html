<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这样，我们也当出到营外就了他去，忍受他所受的凌辱。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Let us go forth, therefore, etc. </em>That the preceding allegory or mystical similitude might not be frigid and lifeless, he connects with it an important duty required of all Christians. And this mode of teaching is what Paul also usually adopts, that he might show to the faithful what things God would have them to be engaged in, while he was endeavoring to draw them away from vain ceremonies; as though he had said, “This is what God demands from you, but not that work in which you in vain weary yourselves.” So now our Apostle speaks; for while he invites us to leave the tabernacle and to follow Christ, he reminds us that a far different thing is required of us from the work of serving God in the shade under the magnificent splendor of the temple; for we must go after him through exiles, flights, reproaches, and all kinds of afflictions. This warfare, in which we must strive even unto blood, he sets in opposition to those shadowy practices of which alone the teachers of ceremonies boasted. </p></div>
