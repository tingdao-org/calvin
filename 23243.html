<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">清心的人有福了，因为他们必得见神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Happy are they who are of a pure heart </em>We might be apt to think, that what is here stated by Christ is in accordance with the judgment of all. <em>Purity of heart </em>is universally acknowledged to be the mother of all virtues. And yet there is hardly one person in a hundred, who does not put craftiness in the place of the greatest virtue. Hence those persons are commonly accounted <em>happy, </em>whose ingenuity is exercised in the successful practice of deceit, who gain dexterous advantages, by indirect means, over those with whom they have intercourse. Christ does not at all agree with carnal reason, when he pronounces those to be <em>happy, </em>who take no delight in cunning, but converse sincerely with men, and express nothing, by word or look, which they do not feel in their heart. Simple people are ridiculed for want of caution, and for not looking sharply enough to themselves. But Christ directs them to higher views, and bids them consider that, if they have not sagacity to deceive in this world, they will enjoy <em>the sight of God </em>in heaven. </p></div>
