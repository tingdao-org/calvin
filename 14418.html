<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因他们无故地为我暗设网罗。无故地挖坑要害我的性命。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>For they have hid for me without a cause. </em>He here declares that he did not take the name of God in vain, nor call upon him for protection without just cause, for he openly asserts his innocence, and complains that he was thus severely afflicted without having committed any crime, or given any occasion to his enemies. It becomes us carefully to mark this, so that no one may rush unadvisedly into God’s presence, nor call upon him for vengeance, without the assurance and testimony of a good conscience. When he says that he was assailed by stratagem, fraud, and wicked practices, there is implied in this a tacit commendation of his own integrity. </p></div>
