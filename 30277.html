<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">太阳出来，热风刮起，草就枯干，花也凋谢，美容就消没了。那富足的人，在他所行的事上，也要这样衰残。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Though the received reading is <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν ταῖς πορείαις</span>, yet I agree with Erasmus, and read the last word, <span class="lang el-gr">πορίαις</span>, without the diphthong “in his riches,” or, with his riches; and the latter I prefer. <span class="cite-ref">(104)</span></p><p><strong>(104)</strong> The received text is regarded as the best reading; the other is found in very few copies. </p></div>
