<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以你们不要叫希西家这样欺哄诱惑你们，也不要信他。因为没有一国一邦的神能救自己的民脱离我手和我列祖的手，何况你们的神更不能救你们脱离我的手。</div></div>
