<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，求你不要向我止住你的慈悲。愿你的慈爱和诚实，常常保佑我。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>O thou Jehovah! withhold not thy tender mercies from me </em>We now see more clearly, what I have just adverted to, that David speaks of his own thankfulness, that he might secure a continuance of God’s favor towards him; and that he opened his mouth in the praises of God, that he might continue to acquire new favors, against which our perverse and ungrateful silence very often closes the gate. We ought, therefore, carefully to observe the relation which the clause, in which David affirms that he closed not his lips, bears to what follows, namely, that God on his part would not contract or stop up the course of his tender mercies; for by this we are taught that God would always be ready to relieve us by his goodness, or rather that it would flow down upon us as from a never-failing fountain, if our own ingratitude did not prevent or cut off its course. <em>The tender mercies </em>of God, which he expresses by the word <span class="lang he-il">רחמיד</span>, <em>rachamecha, </em>and of which he here speaks, differ little from his goodness. It was not, however, without cause that David chose to make this distinction. It could only be, first, because he was unable otherwise to satisfy himself in extolling the grace of God; and, secondly, because it was requisite to show that the source from which the mercy and goodness of God proceed, when he is moved in compassion for our miseries to aid and succor us. Then he places his confidence of salvation in the goodness and faithfulness of God, for we must of necessity begin (as I have said a little before) at the free favor of God, that his bounty may extend even to us. But as we are unable to discern that God is gracious to us until he grant us some assurance of his love, his constancy is, with much propriety, placed in connection with his truth in keeping his promises. </p></div>
