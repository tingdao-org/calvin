<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我要使他们彼此同心同道，好叫他们永远敬畏我，使他们和他们后世的子孙得福乐，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He more clearly explains the last verse; for he mentions the effects of the favor referred to. God indeed includes everything in one word, when he declares that he will be our God, for he thus adopts us as his children. Hence comes the certainty as to our heavenly inheritance, and also as to his mercy, which is better than life. There is then nothing that can be desired beyond this benefit, that is, when God offers himself to us, and deigns to receive and embrace us as his people. </p><p>But as I have already said, we do not fully comprehend the benefit of this doctrine; for, first, we are very tardy and dull, we perceive not what God means by this expression, and then we know how much our nature is prone to diffidence, so far is the distance between us and God. Hence this doctrine has need of explanation. Therefore the Prophet, after having pointed out the cause and the beginning of all blessings, now mentions the effects, which more fully confirm what he had said. Hence he says, <em>I willgive to them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever: </em>for God does not otherwise own us as his people, nor can he be our Father, except he regenumtes us by his Spirit; for it is of regeneration that the Prophet here speaks. But I must defer the rest until to-morrow. </p></div>
