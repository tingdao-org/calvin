<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以丈夫活着，她若归于别人，便叫淫妇。丈夫若死了，她就脱离了丈夫的律法，虽然归于别人，也不是淫妇。</div></div>
