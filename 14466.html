<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们的刀，必刺入自己的心，他们的弓，必被折断。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>In the 15<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, David is not speaking of the laughter of God, but is denouncing vengeance against the ungodly, just as we have already seen in the second psalm, at the fourth verse, that although God, by conniving at the wicked, has often suffered them for a time to run to every excess in mirth and rioting, yet he at length speaks to them in his anger to overthrow them. The amount of what is stated is, that the ungodly should prevail so little, that the sword which they had drawn should return into their own bowels, and that their bow should be broken in pieces. </p></div>
