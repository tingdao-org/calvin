<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大卫对祭司说，实在约有三日我们没有亲近妇人。我出来的时候，虽是寻常行路，少年人的器皿还是洁净的。何况今日不更是洁净吗？</div></div>
