<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">即便如此，我们所事奉的神能将我们从烈火的窑中救出来。王阿，他也必救我们脱离你的手。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>And when they add — <em>God is sufficiently powerful to preserve us; and if not, we are prepared for death, </em>they point out to us what ought to raise our minds above all trials, namely, the preciousness of our life in God’s sight, since he can liberate us if he pleases. Since, therefore, we have sufficient protection in God, let us not think any method of preserving our life better than to throw ourselves entirely on his protection, and to cast all our cares upon him. And as to the second clause, we must remark this, even if the Lord should wish to magnify his own glory by our death, we ought to offer up this as a lawful sacrifice; and sincere piety does not flourish in our hearts unless our minds are always prepared to make this sacrifice. Thus I wished to remark these things shortly now, and with God’s permission, I will explain them fully to-morrow. </p></div>
