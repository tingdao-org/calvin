<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">起身下埃及去，并没有求问我。要靠法老的力量，加添自己的力量，并投在埃及的荫下。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>They walk that they may go down into Egypt. </em>The reason why the Prophet condemns this “going down” has been already explained; <span class="cite-ref">(286)</span> but as their guilt was aggravated by open and heinous obstinacy, he again repeats that they did this without asking at the mouth of God, and even in the face of his prohibition. </p><p><em>Strengthening themselves with the strength of Pharaoh. </em>He again draws their attention to the source of the evil, when he says that it was done for the purpose of acquiring strength, because they placed confidence in the forces of the Egyptians. Hence arose that lawless desire of entering into a league. In this way they shewed that they cared little about the power of God, and did not greatly trust in him; and they openly displayed their unbelief. </p><p>It might be objected, that men are the servants of God, and that it is lawful for any one to make use of their services, whenever they are needed. I reply, that while we make use of the labors and services of men, it ought to be in such a manner as to depend on God alone. But there was another reason peculiar to the Jews, for they knew that God had forbidden them to call the Egyptians to their assistance, and, by doing so, they withheld from God all that they ascribed to Pharaoh and to his forces. Thus it is not without good reason that Isaiah contrasts Pharaoh with God; for the creatures are opposed to God, and enter, as it were, into contest with him when they rise up against God, or whenever men abuse them, or place their hearts and confidence in them, or desire them more than is lawful. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(286)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
