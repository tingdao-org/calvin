<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Of which I am made a minister. </em>Mark under what character he suffers for the Church — as being a <em>minister</em>, not to <em>give </em>the price of redemption, (as Augustine dexterously and piously expresses himself,) but to <em>proclaim </em>it. He calls himself, however, in this instance, a minister of the Church on a different ground from that on which he called himself elsewhere, (<span class="bvs">1Co_4:1</span>,) a <em>minister of God</em>, and a little ago, (<span class="bvs">Col_1:23</span>,) a <em>minister of the gospel</em>. For the Apostles serve God and Christ for the advancement of the glory of both: they serve the Church, and administer the gospel itself, with a view to promote salvation. There is, therefore, a different reason for the ministry in these expressions, but the one cannot subsist without the other. He says, however, <em>towards you</em>, that they may know that his office has a connection also with them. </p><p><em>To fulfill the word. </em>He states the end of his ministry — that the word of God may be effectual, as it is, when it is obediently received. For this is the excellence of the gospel, that it is the </p><p>power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Rom_1:16</span>.) </p><p>God, therefore, gives efficacy and influence to his word through means of the Apostles. For although preaching itself, whatever may be its issue, is the fulfilling of the word, yet it is the fruit that shews at length <span class="cite-ref">(339)</span> that the seed has not been sown in vain. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(339)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toutesfois c’est a proprement parler, le fruit qui monstre en fin</span>;” — “Yet it is, properly speaking, the fruit that shews at last.” </p></div></div>
