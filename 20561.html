<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并且我必使你在四围的列国中，在经过的众人眼前，成了荒凉和羞辱。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He explains what we saw before more at length, whence also we understand that in the next verse God had not softened his anger, but proclaimed the ultimate destruction of the nation. He says therefore, <em>that the Jews shall be desolate, </em>as they translate it: it also signifies dryness, and hence is the name for a desert. But it suits this place to say, <em>the Jews shall be laid waste, and a reproach among the nations: </em>for they were formerly a celebrated nation: God had ennobled them with remarkable gifts, so that they excelled in dignity in the sight of all the nations. Now he says, <em>they should be like a vast desert, and in utter ruin, and a reproach; </em>and not only is this rumor spread abroad, but all travelers through that land are witnesses of this reproach. But in the next verse this is followed out more at length. </p></div>
