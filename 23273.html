<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们听见有话说，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_5:38</span><strong>.</strong><em>An eye for an eye. Here </em>another error is corrected. God had enjoined, by his law, (<span class="bvs">Lev_24:20</span>,) that judges and magistrates should punish those who had done injuries, by making them endure as much as they had inflicted. The consequence was, that every one seized on this as a pretext for taking private revenge. They thought that they did no wrong, provided they were not the first to make the attack, but only, when injured, returned like for like. Christ informs them, on the contrary, that, though judges were entrusted with the defense of the community, and were invested with authority to restrain the wicked and repress their violence, yet it is the duty of every man to bear patiently the injuries which he receives. </p></div>
