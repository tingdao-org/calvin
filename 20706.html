<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我耶和华说话，所说的必定成就，不再耽延。你们这悖逆之家，我所说的话必趁你们在世的日子成就。这是主耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms the last verse. there is some obscurity in the context of the words, but as to the general sense, the Prophet wishes to teach simply that what even God had spoken should be shortly accomplished, since God wishes to assert his own fidelity by the execution of the vengeance which he had threatened by his servants. The Prophet here means, that it is not right to separate God’s word from its effect, because God who speaks is not divided against himself. Whenever he opens his mouth, he stretches out his hand to fulfill his words. Now we understand the Prophet’s meaning; and hence we may collect the usefulness of this teaching. For, because God’s word seems cold to us and to be dissipated into air, we must always consider his hand. Whenever the Prophets speak, let God come before our eyes, and let him come not merely with bare words, but armed with his power, as if his hand was in some way included in his word. This is the meaning of the whole verse, <em>I Jehovah will utter a word, and whatever I shall utter that will I do: it shall be no lower delayed, </em>but, as I have often said, it shall return, <em>nay in your days, O rebellious house, I will do what I have spoken by my servants. </em>Here he expresses what might yet appear doubtful. For since a thousand years are with God as one day, the time might be thought near, even if the city had not been taken and destroyed with the temple for thirty years. But now God, after the manner of men, defines the time to be near, because those who were then alive should see the accomplishment of the prophecies which they had despised. It follows — </p></div>
