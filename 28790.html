<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Let all your things be done in love </em>Again he repeats what is the rule in all those transactions, in which we have dealings with one another. He wishes, then, that <em>love </em>shall be the directress; because the Corinthians erred chiefly in this respect — that every one looked to himself without caring for others. </p></div>
