<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>I can do all things through Christ </em>As he had boasted of things that were very great, <span class="cite-ref">(249)</span> in order that this might not be attributed to pride or furnish others with occasion of foolish boasting, he adds, that it is by Christ that he is endowed with this fortitude. “<em>I can do all things, </em>” says he, “but it is in Christ, not by my own power, for it is Christ that supplies me with strength.” Hence we infer, that Christ will not be less strong and invincible in us also, if, conscious of our own weakness, we place reliance upon his power alone. When he says <em>all things, </em>he means merely those things which belong to his calling. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(249)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De choses grandes et excellentes</span>;” — “Of things great and excellent.” </p></div></div>
