<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣从死里复活以后，向门徒显现，这是第三次。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>The third time. </em>The number <em>three </em>refers to the distance of time. Christ had already appeared to his disciples more than <em>seven </em>times, but all that had been transacted in one day is included in one manifestation. The Evangelist, therefore, means that Christ had been seen by the disciples at intervals, in order to confirm their belief of his resurrection. </p></div>
