<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亲爱的弟兄们，我们虽是这样说，却深信你们的行为强过这些，而且近乎得救。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>But we are persuaded, etc. </em>As the preceding sentences were like thunderbolts, by which readers might have been struck dead, it was needful to mitigate this severity. He therefore says now, that he did not speak in this strain, as though he entertained such an opinion of them. And doubtless whosoever wishes to do good by teaching, ought so to treat his disciples as ever to add encouragement to them rather than to diminish it, for there is nothing that can alienate us more from attending to the truth than to see that we are deemed to be past hope. The Apostle then testifies that he thus warned the Jews, because he had a good hope of them, and was anxious to lead them to salvation. We hence conclude, that not only the reprobate ought to be reproved severely and with sharp earnestness, but also the elect themselves, even those whom we deem to be the children of God. </p></div>
