<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">厨役就把收存的腿拿来，摆在扫罗面前，撒母耳说，这是所留下的，放在你面前。吃吧。因我请百姓的时候，特意为你存留这肉到此时。当日，扫罗就与撒母耳同席。</div></div>
