<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但现在耶和华说，三年之内，照雇工的年数，摩押的荣耀，与他的群众，必被藐视，余剩的人，甚少无几。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Three years. </em>The time is fixed, not only for the sake of certainty, but likewise that believers may not become faint through longer delay. He alludes to agreements among men, in which it is customary to fix the time agreed on, which the parties are not at liberty to transgress. This is especially the case in the labors of <em>hirelings</em>, from whom Scripture frequently draws a comparison in this respect, that they earnestly long for the appointed day when they shall receive their reward; for they groan, as it were, under the burden, and grievously dislike their daily toils. (<span class="bvs">Job_7:1</span>.) In this way the Lord says, that he fixes a day for the Moabites, in which they shall not escape from the entire destruction of their power. </p><p><em>With all his multitude. </em>He expressly mentions a <em>multitude</em>, because their number was great, and because they boasted of it, and thought that they were invincible. When he adds, that <em>the remnant shall be feeble, </em>he means that there will be so great a change, that they will have no resemblance to their former condition; for nothing will be left but a sad and shocking sight. </p><p>  </p><p>End Of Volume First. </p></div>
