<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Knowing, that as </em>However there might be some of the Corinthians that were drawn away for the time by the calumnies of the false Apostles, so as to entertain less honorable views of Paul, on seeing him shamefully handled before the world, he, nevertheless, associates them with himself both in fellowship of afflictions, and in hope of consolation. <span class="cite-ref">(237)</span> Thus he corrects their perverse and malignant view, without subjecting them to an open rebuke. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(237)</span> The Corinthians were <span class="lang el-gr">κοινωνοί</span><em>partakers of</em>, or <em>in communion with him in his afflictions</em>. What is more humble and lowly (<span class="lang el-gr">τί ταπεινοφρωνέστερον</span>) than Paul in this expression? saith Chrysostom — they who had not in the least measure shared with him in sufferings, yet he maketh them copartners with him. They are, as Salmeron expresseth it, <em>Copartners in the gain and in the loss with Paul</em>. They venture (as it were) in the ship together.” — <em>Burgesse</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
