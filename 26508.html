<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>My sheep hear my voice. </em>He proves by an argument drawn from contraries, that they are not <em>sheep</em>, because they do not obey the Gospel. For God effectually calls all whom he has elected, so that the <em>sheep </em>of Christ are proved by their faith. And, indeed, the reason why the name of <em>sheep </em>is applied to believers is, that they surrender themselves to God, to be governed by the hand of the Chief Shepherd, and, laying aside the fierceness of their nature, become mild and teachable. It is no small consolation to faithful teachers, that, though the greater part of the world do not listen to Christ, yet he has his <em>sheep whom he knows</em>, <em>and by whom he is also known </em>Let them do their utmost to bring the whole world into the fold of Christ; but when they do not succeed according to their wish, let them be satisfied with this single consideration, that they who are <em>sheep </em>will be gathered by their agency. The rest has been already explained. </p></div>
