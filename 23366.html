<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣说，狐狸有洞，天空的飞鸟有窝，人子却没有枕头的地方。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Foxes have holes. </em>The Son of God describes by these words what was his condition while he lived on the earth, but, at the same time, informs his disciples what sort of life they must be prepared to expect. And yet it is strange that Christ should say, that he had not a foot of earth on which he could <em>lay his head, </em>while there were many godly and benevolent persons, who would willingly receive him into their houses. But this was spoken, it ought to be observed, as a warning to the scribe, not to expect an abundant and rich hire, as if he had a wealthy master, while the master himself receives a precarious subsistence in borrowed houses. </p></div>
