<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>They raised the multitude. </em>We see how unjustly the holy men were handled. Because they had no place granted them to defend themselves, it was an easy matter to oppress them, though they were guiltless. We see, likewise, that it is no new matter for magistrates to be carried away with the rage of the people as with a tempest, especially when the injury toucheth those who are strangers and unknown, at whose hands they look for no reward; because they will not come in danger for nothing. For then they care not for reason or equity, neither do they hear the matter,<span class="cite-ref">(259)</span> but one driveth forward another without any resistance, and all things are done out of order, as when they run unto some great fire. But it came to pass, by the singular goodness of God, that so great heat was stayed by and by; for so soon as the magistrates profess that they will know farther of the matter, the multitude is appeased; assurance [security] is taken; and, at length, the matter is ended.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(259)</span></p><p>“ Nec suscipitur causae cognitio,” nor do theytake cognisance of the cause. </p></div></div>
