<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Therefore sprang there even of one, etc. </em>He now also reminds the Jews, that it was by faith that they were the descendants of Abraham; for he was as it were half dead, <span class="cite-ref">(220)</span> and Sarah his wife, who had been barren in the flower of her age, was now sterile, being far advanced in years. Sooner then might oil be expected to flow from a stone, than a nation to proceed from them: and yet there sprang from them an innumerable multitude. If now the Jews are proud of their origin, let them consider what it was. Whatever they are, everything is doubtless to be ascribed to the faith of Abraham and Sarah. It hence follows, that they cannot retain and defend the position they have acquired in any other way than by faith. </p><p><strong>(220)</strong> Calvin renders<span class="lang el-gr">ταῦτα </span> adverbially “quidem,” “and indeed dead;” Doddridge “in his repeat;” Macknight, “to these matters;” Stuart “as to these things.” But the word is rendered in <span class="bvs">Luk_6:23</span>, “in the like manner;” and this would be the best rendering here. Abraham was like Sarah, “dead” as to the power of begetting children, — “Therefore even from one, and him in a like manner dead, there sprang so many as the stars,” etc. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
