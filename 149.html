<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>The earth also was corrupt before God</em>. In the former clause of this verse Moses describes that impious contempt of God, which had left no longer any religion in the world; but the light of equity being extinct, all men had plunged into sin. In the second clause he declares, that the love of oppression, that frauds, injuries, rapines, and all kinds of injustice, prevailed. And these are the fruits of impiety, that men, when they have revolted from God, — forgetful of mutual equity among themselves, — are carried forward to insane ferocity, to rapines, and to oppressions of all sorts. God again declares that he had <em>seen </em>this; in order that he may commend his longsuffering to us. The earth is here put for its inhabitants; and the explanation immediately follows, ‘that all flesh had corrupted its way.’ Yet the word flesh is not here understood as before, in a bad sense; but is meant for <em>men</em>, without any mark of censure: as in other places of Scripture, </p><p>‘All flesh shall see the glory of the Lord,’ (<span class="bvs">Isa_40:5</span>.) </p><p>‘Let all flesh be silent before the Lord,’ (<span class="bvs">Zec_2:13</span>.) </p></div>
