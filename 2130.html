<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人若引诱没有受聘的处女，与她行淫，他总要交出聘礼，娶她为妻。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Hence, also, it is manifest that, although God remits the judicial penalty, fornication is displeasing to Him. As to the spiritual judgment of the conscience, there were expiations to propitiate Him; He here only has consideration for young females, lest, being deceived, and having lost their virginity, they should become prostitutes; and thus the land should be defiled by whoredom. The remedy is, that lie who has corrupted girl should be compelled to marry her, and also to give tie a dowry from his own property, lest, if he should afterwards cast her off, she should go away from her bed penniless. But, if the marriage should not please her father, the penalty imposed on her seducer is, that he should assign her a wedding portion. </p></div>
