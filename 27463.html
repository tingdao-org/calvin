<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>For Moses hath. </em>This place, in my judgment, hath been badly expounded, and drawn into a contrary sense. For interpreters think that James addeth this, because it were superfluous to prescribe anything to the Jews, who were well acquainted with the doctrine of the law, and to whom it was read every Sabbath-day; and they pick out this meaning, Let us be content to require these few things at the hands of the Gentiles, which are not accustomed to bear the yoke of the law; as touching the Jews they have Moses, out of whom they may learn more. Some do also gather out of this place, that circumcision, with its appurtenances, ought to be observed even at this day among the Jews. But they reason unfitly and unskillfully, though that exposition which I have set down<span class="cite-ref">(141)</span> were true. But James had a far other meaning; to wit, he teachers that it cannot be that ceremonies can be abolished so quickly, as it were, at the first dash; because the Jews had now a long time been acquainted with the doctrine of the law, and Moses had his preachers; therefore, it stood them upon to redeem concord for a short thee, until such time as the liberty gotten by Christ might, by little and little, appear more plainly. This is that which is said in the common proverb, That it was meet that the old ceremonies should be buried with some honor. Those who are skillful in the Greek tongue shall know that that last member, When he is read every Sabbath-day in the synagogues, was by me changed not without cause, for avoiding of doubtfulness.<span class="cite-ref">(142)</span></p><p><strong>(141)</strong></p><p>“ Quam retuli,” to which I have referred </p><p><strong>(142)</strong></p><p>“ Nempe, vitandae ambiguitatis causa,” namely, for the purpose of avoiding ambiguity. </p></div>
