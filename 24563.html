<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">孩子的父亲立时喊着说，我信。但我信不足，求主帮助。（有古卷作立时流泪地喊着说）</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Lord, I believe. </em>He declares that he <em>believes</em>, and yet acknowledges himself to have <em>unbelief </em>These two statements may appear to contradict each other, but there is none of us that does not experience both of them in himself. As our <em>faith </em>is never perfect, it follows that we are partly <em>unbelievers; </em>but God forgives us, and exercises such forbearance towards us, as to reckon us believers on account of a small portion of faith. It is our duty, in the meantime, carefully to shake off the remains of infidelity which adhere to us, to strive against them, and to pray to God to correct them, and, as often as we are engaged in this conflict, to fly to him for aid. If we duly inquire what portion has been bestowed on each, it will evidently appear that there are very few who are eminent in faith, few who have a moderate portion, and very many who have but a small measure. </p></div>
