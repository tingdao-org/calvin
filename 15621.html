<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>He did not suffer men to hurt them </em>Abraham and his children had not merely two or three enemies: they were harassed by whole nations. As then many rose up one after another in troops against them, the Psalmist says indefinitely, that men were withheld from hurting them; for <span class="lang he-il">אדם</span>, <em>adam, </em>is the word here used, which is the one most generally employed to signify <em>man </em>He next amplifies the love of God towards his servants, in setting himself in opposition to kings for their sake. When God did not spare even the kings of Egypt and Gerar, it is evident how precious the welfare of Abraham and his offspring was in his sight. We have said a little before that the holy fathers were of no estimation in the eyes of the world. God therefore displayed his goodness so much the more signally in preferring them to kings. Now we here see, that the Jews were humbled in the person of their fathers, that they might not imagine that they found favor in the sight of God by any merit of their own. </p></div>
