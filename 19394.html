<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我何时论到一邦或一国说，要建立，栽植。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>On the other hand, he affirms, that the lost are restored, when the Lord <em>speaks suddenly, of a nation and of a kingdom, to build and to plant</em>; as though it was said, — “I will not only forgive, but I am ready to bestow blessings on those whom I had previously rejected as mine enemies.” Then God amplifies his goodness when he says, that he will not only forgive the sins of men, so as freely to pardon them, but that he is ready to bestow on them all kinds of blessings, if they seek to be reconciled to him. </p></div>
