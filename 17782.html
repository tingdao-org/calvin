<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并且耶和华将人迁到远方，在这境内撇下的地土很多。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Till the Lord have removed men far away. </em>These words contain nothing new, but merely an explanation of the former verse, and a description by other words of the ruin that shall overtake Judea; namely, that God will send the inhabitants <em>far away</em>. He asserts that those who shall survive the war will not be exempted from punishment, for they will be led into captivity. And next he adds a general clause about the desolation of the land; as if he had said that it would be desolate and bereft of inhabitants, because some would flee away, others would be driven into banishment, and others would perish by the sword. Such is the reward prepared for obstinate and rebellious persons, who add crime to crime, till the indignation of God rise to such a height that it cannot be appeased. </p></div>
