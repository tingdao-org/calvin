<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我与我祖我父同睡的时候，你要将我带出埃及，葬在他们所葬的地方。约瑟说，我必遵着你的命而行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>But I will lie with my fathers </em><span class="cite-ref">(188)</span> It appears from this passage, that the word “sleep,” whenever it is put for “die,” does not refer to the soul, but to the body. For, what did it concern him, to be buried with his fathers in the double cave, <span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> unless to testify that he was associated with them after death? And by what bond were he and they joined together, except this, that not even death itself could extinguish the power of their faith; which would seem to utter this voice from the same sepulcher, Now also we have a common inheritance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(188)</span> Dormaim, “I will sleep.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(189)</span> The cave of Machpelah. See above, on <span class="bvs">Gen_23:9</span>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
