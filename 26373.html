<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>Some of them wished to seize him. </em>By these words the Evangelist means, that they not only despised Christ, but that their wicked rejection of him was accompanied by cruelty and eagerness to do him injury; for superstition is always cruel. That their efforts were unavailing, we ought to ascribe to the providence of God; for since Christ’s <em>hour was not yet come</em>, as has been formerly said, guarded by the protection of his Father, on which he relied, he surmounted all dangers. </p></div>
