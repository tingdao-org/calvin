<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人凭着自己说，是求自己的荣耀。惟有求那差他来者的荣耀，这人是真的，在他心里没有不义。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>He who speaketh from himself. </em>Hitherto he has showed that there is no other reason why men are blind, but because they are not governed by the fear of God. He now puts another mark on the doctrine itself, by which it may be known whether it is of God or of man. For every thing that displays the glory of God is holy and divine; but every thing that contributes to the ambition of men, and, by exalting them, obscures the glory of God, not only has no claim to be believed, but ought to be vehemently rejected. He who shall make the glory of God the object at which he aims will never go wrong; he who shall try and prove by this touchstone what is brought forward in the name of God will never be deceived by the semblance of right. We are also reminded by it that no man can faithfully discharge the office of teacher in the Church, unless he be void of ambition, and resolve to make it his sole object to promote, to the utmost of his power, the glory of God. When he says that <em>there is no unrighteousness in him, </em>he means that there is nothing wicked or hypocritical, but that he does what becomes an upright and sincere minister of God. </p></div>
