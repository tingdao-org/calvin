<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当那日，我必将以色列地的谷，就是海东人所经过的谷，赐给歌革为坟地，使经过的人到此停步。在那里人必葬埋歌革和他的群众，就称那地为哈们歌革谷。</div></div>
