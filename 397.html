<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">后来夏甲给亚伯兰生了一个儿子。亚伯兰给他起名叫以实玛利。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And Abram called </em>Hagar had been commanded to give that name to her son; but Moses follows the order of nature; because fathers, by the imposition of the name, declare the power which they have over their sons. We may easily gather, that Hagar, when she returned home, related the events which had occurred. Therefore, Abram shows himself to be obedient and grateful to God: because he both names his son according to the command of the angel, and celebrates the goodness of God in having hearkened to the miseries of Hagar. </p></div>
