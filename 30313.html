<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">虚浮的人哪，你愿意知道没有行为的信心是死的吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20</strong><em>But wilt thou know</em>. We must understand the state of the question, for the dispute here is not respecting the cause of justification, but only what avails a profession of faith without works, and what opinion we are to form of it. Absurdly then do they act who strive to prove by this passage that man is justified by works, because James meant no such thing, for the proofs which he subjoins refer to this declaration, that no faith, or only a dead faith, is without works. No one will ever understand what is said, nor judge wisely of words, except he who keeps in view the design of the writer. </p></div>
