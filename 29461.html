<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我的神必照他荣耀的丰富，在基督耶稣里，使你们一切所需用的都充足。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19</strong><em>My God will supply </em>Some read <em>impleat </em> — in the <em>optative </em>— <em>May he supply. </em><span class="cite-ref">(258)</span> While I do not reject this reading, I approve more of the other. He expressly makes mention of God as <em>his, </em>because he owns and acknowledges as done to himself whatever kindness is shewn to his servants. They had therefore been truly sowing in the Lord’s field, from which a sure and abundant harvest might be expected. Nor does he promise them merely a reward in the future life, but even in respect of the necessities of the present life: <em>“ </em>Do not think that you have impoverished yourselves; God, whom I serve, will abundantly furnish you with everything necessary for you.” The phrase, <em>in glory, </em>ought to be taken in place of the adverb <em>gloriously, </em>as meaning <em>magnificently, </em>or <em>splendidly. </em>He adds, however, <em>by Christ, </em>in whose name everything that we do is acceptable to God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(258)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme si c’estoit vn souhait que sainct Paul feist</span>;<em>” </em>— <em>“ </em>As if it were a wish that St. Paul expressed.” </p></div></div>
