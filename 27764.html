Whence it is also gathered, that they trouble Paul unjustly, and that they sought so sore against his life without any cause. For if they had persecuted him lawfully, they would have trusted to the goodness of their cause, and not have suffered him to be judged according to law. Now, when as they seek to kill him, it appeareth that they have no reason.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(560)</span></p><p>“ Odium in adversarios retorquet,” retorts upon his adversaries their hatred. </p></div></div>
