<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那时你们近前来，站在山下。山上有火焰冲天，并有昏黑，密云，幽暗。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>And ye came near, and stood. </em>This explanatory narrative is intended to prove the same thing, viz., that Moses was only the ambassador and minister of God, because the mountain burned in the sight of all the people, that God might be manifested, speaking from the midst of the fire. His statement that they only heard the voice, but saw no similitude, may be understood as a kind of admission, <em>(concessionis.) </em>Thus the two clauses would be read adversatively, “Although no similitude appeared, yet a voice penetrated even to your ears.” But I conceive that this was expressly stated more clearly to shew that it was the voice of God, and not proceeding from a human being; for no man could have so concealed himself by artifice as to prevent himself from being seen to speak, whereas they beheld the voice come out of the fire without any external instrumentality. </p></div>
