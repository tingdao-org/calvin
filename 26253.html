<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>42.</strong><em>That you have not the love of God in you. The love of God </em>is here put for all religious feelings; for no man can <em>love God </em>without beholding him with admiration and submitting entirely to his authority; as, on the other hand, when <em>the love of God </em>does not prevail, there can be no desire to obey him. That is the reason why Moses gives this as the summary or recapitulation (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀνακεφαλαίωσις</span>) of the Law: </p><p>thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_6:5</span>.) </p></div>
