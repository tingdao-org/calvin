<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">后来却又反悔，叫所任去自由的仆人婢女回来，勉强他们仍为仆婢。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds, <em>And they afterwards turned, </em>that is, after they had heard and obeyed. The turning refers to a change of purpose, for they immediately repented of what they had done. They had felt some fear of God, and then equity and kindness prevailed; but they soon turned or changed. The word is taken sometimes in a good, and sometimes in a bad sense. He says that they <em>turned, </em>or returned, because they receded or turned back after having commenced a right course. <em>And they remanded; </em>there is a correspondence between the verbs <span class="lang he-il">ישובו</span><em>ishibu, </em>they <em>turned, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">ישיבו</span><em>ishibu, </em>they <em>remanded, </em>or made to return <em>the servants and maids whom they let go free, and brought them under as servants and maids </em>There is no doubt but that the Jews alleged some excuse when they thus remanded their servants, and robbed them of the privilege of freedom: but God designed that they should act in sincerity and without disguise. Whatever, then, subtle men may contrive as an excuse for oppressing the miserable, and however they may disguise things before men, yet God, who requires integrity, does not allow such disguises, for he would have us to deal honestly with our neighbors, for all craftiness is condemned by him. </p></div>
