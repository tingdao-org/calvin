<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这十二使徒的名，头一个叫西门，又称彼得，还有他兄弟安得烈。西庇太的儿子雅各，和雅各的兄弟约翰。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>The first, Simon, who is called Peter </em>The Church of Rome displays extreme folly in drawing from this passage their doctrine of the primacy. That Simon Peter was the first among the apostles we readily allow, but what was true in reference to a few persons, cannot, on any proper grounds, be extended to the whole world. Besides, the circumstance of his being mentioned first, does not imply that he possessed authority over his companions. Granting all that they ask regarding Peter, his rank will be of no avail to the Roman See, till they prove that wicked and sacrilegious apostles are Peter’s successors. </p></div>
