<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Deliver me</em>. After he has declared himself to be bound by so many of God’s benefits that he cannot boast of his own merits, and thus raised his mind to higher expectation, he now mentions his own necessity, as if he would say, “O Lord, unless thou choosest to reduce so many excellent gifts to nothing, now is the time for thee to succor one, and to avert the destruction which, through my brother, is suspended over me.” But having thus expressed his fear, he adds a clause concerning the blessing promised him, that he may confirm himself in the promises made to him. <em>To slay the mother with the children</em>, I suppose to have been a proverbial saying among the Jews, which means to leave nothing remaining. It is a metaphor taken from birds, when hawks seize the young with their dams, and empty the whole nest. <span class="cite-ref">(105)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(105)</span> Perhaps Calvin’s interpretation would appear more striking, had the original been more literally rendered, “the mother upon the children,” (<span class="lang he-il">על בנים</span>,) which would represent the hawk as pouncing upon the parent bird when seated on her young, or protecting them beneath her feathers. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
