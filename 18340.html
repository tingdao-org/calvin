<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若不然，怎能打败我主臣仆中最小的军长呢？你竟倚靠埃及的战车马兵吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And how dost thou despise? </em><span class="cite-ref">(35)</span> He confirms the preceding statement, and shews that ttezekiah is so far from being able to endure the presence of his king, that he ought not to be compared to the very smallest of his captains. In this insolent manner does he taunt him, that the Jews may not derive courage from the absence of Sennacherib, who was still detained by the siege of Lachish. Although, therefore, Sennacherib does not yet appear before them with his whole army, Rabshakeh boasts that his lieutenants are sufficiently powerful, so that Hezekiah ought not to hesitate to make submission. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(35)</span> “How then wilt thou turn away?” — Eng.
