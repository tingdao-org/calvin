<div class="comment-content"><p>I shall now only touch briefly on the <em>extreme ones in a corner, </em>or those bounded by a corner, who were almost unknown to the Jews on account of their distance. <span class="cite-ref">(142)</span> After having spoken of nations so very remote, that he might not by prolixity be tedious, he mentions <em>all the extreme ones in a corner, </em>that is, those who were bounded by the farthest limits. As to <em>Dedan, Tema, and Buz, </em>we know that these countries derived their names from their founders. Who Dedan was, we learn from Moses, and also who Tema and Buz were. (<span class="bvs">Gen_25:3</span>; <span class="bvs">1Ch_5:14</span>.) Two of them were descendants of Abraham by Keturah. <span class="cite-ref">(143)</span> There is no need of saying more of these countries, for they are not known by us at this day, and we cannot learn from geographers the extent of any of these countries; for there was hardly a place at the time when heathen writers began their records, which had not long before changed its name. We however conclude that these were eastern countries. It follows — </p><p><strong>(142)</strong> See Note in vol. 1, p. 506. </p><p><strong>(143)</strong> This is not quite correct. Dedan — there are two of this name mentioned, <span class="bvs">Gen_10:7</span>, and <span class="bvs">Gen_25:3</span>; the latter is probably meant here. Tema was one of Ishmael’s race, <span class="bvs">Gen_25:15</span>. See also <span class="bvs">Job_6:19</span>, and <span class="bvs">Isa_21:14</span>. — Buz was one of Nachor’s posterity, <span class="bvs">Gen_22:21</span>; and of this family was Elihu, the most remarkable of Job’s friends; he was a Buzite. <span class="bvs">Job_32:1</span>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
