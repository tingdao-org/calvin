<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人若娶他的姐妹，无论是异母同父的，是异父同母的，彼此见了下体，这是可耻的事，他们必在本民的眼前被剪除。他露了姐妹的下体，必担当自己的罪孽。</div></div>
