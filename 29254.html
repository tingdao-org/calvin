<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">用启示使我知道福音的奥秘，正如我以前略略写过的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>That by revelation. </em>Some might imagine, that, in attempting to discharge the office of an apostle, he had acted rashly, and was now paying the penalty of his rashness. It was this that made him so earnest in pleading the Divine authority for all his transactions. The present instance, on account of its novelty, had few supporters; and therefore he calls it a <em>mystery. </em>By this name he endeavors to remove the prejudice which the general displeasure at the event was fitted to excite. His own personal interest in the matter was less regarded than that of the Ephesians, who were deeply concerned in the information, that, through the settled purpose of God, they had been called by Paul’s ministry. Lest what is little known should forthwith become the object of suspicion, the word <em>mystery </em>places it in opposition to the perverse judgments and opinions which were then prevalent in the world. </p><p><em>By revelation he made known to me the mystery. </em>Paul draws the line of distinction between himself and those fanatics, who ascribe to God and to the Holy Spirit their own idle dreams. The false apostles boast of revelations, but it is a false boast. Paul was persuaded that his revelation was true, could prove it to others, and speaks of it as a fact of which no doubt could be entertained. </p><p><em>As I wrote a little before. </em>This refers either to a rapid glance at the same subject in the second chapter, or — which appears to be the general opinion — to another Epistle. If the former exposition be adopted, it will be proper to translate, <em>as I wrote before in few words; </em>for the subject had received nothing more than a passing notice; but the latter being, as I have said, the prevailing opinion, I prefer translating, <em>as I wrote a little before. </em>The phrase, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐν ὀλίγῳ,</span>) which Erasmus has translated <em>in a few words, </em>appears rather to refer to time. On this supposition there would be an implied comparison between the present and the former writings. But nothing would be more unlike the fact, than to contrast them on the score of brevity; for a more concise mode of expression than this passing glance can hardly be imagined. The phrase, <em>a little before, </em>seems purposely to be used as an appeal to their remembrance of a recent occurrence, though I do not insist on this point. There is more difficulty in the next verse. </p></div>
