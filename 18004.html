<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">都要撇给山间的鸷鸟，和地上的野兽。夏天鸷鸟要宿在其上，冬天野兽都卧在其中。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>They shall be left together. </em><span class="cite-ref">(23)</span> He means that they will be cast aside as a thing of no value, as John the Baptist also compares them to chaff, which is thrown on the dunghill. (<span class="bvs">Mat_3:12</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_3:17</span>.) Thus Isaiah shews that they will be exposed to the wild beasts and to the fowls, so that the fowls will nestle in them in summer, and the wild beasts will make their lairs in them in winter; as if he had said, that not only men, but the wild beasts themselves will disdain them. Such therefore is the end of wicked men, who, situated in a lofty place, and thinking that they are beyond all danger, despise every one but themselves. The fowls and the beasts of prey will make use of them for nests and for food. They will be thrown down, I say, not only beneath all men, but even beneath the beasts themselves, and, being exposed to every kind of insult and dishonor, they will be a proof of the wonderful providence of God. <span class="cite-ref">(24)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(23)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(24)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
