<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">是但支派一个妇人的儿子。他父亲是推罗人，他善用金，银，铜，铁，石，木，和紫色，蓝色，朱红色线与细麻制造各物，并精于雕刻，又能想出各样的巧工。请你派定这人，与你的巧匠和你父，我主大卫的巧匠一同做工。</div></div>
