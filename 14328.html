<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，我曾求告你。我向耶和华恳求，说，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>O Jehovah! I cried unto thee. </em>Now follows the fruit of David’s chastisement. He had been previously sleeping profoundly, and fostering his indolence by forgetfulness; but being now awakened all on a sudden with fear and terror, he begins to cry to God. As the iron which has contracted rust cannot be put to any use until it be heated again in the fire, and beaten with the hammer, so in like manner, when carnal security has once got the mastery, no one can give himself cheerfully to prayer, until he has been softened by the cross, and thoroughly subdued. And this is the chief advantage of afflictions, that while they make us sensible of our wretchedness, they stimulate us again to supplicate the favor of God. </p></div>
