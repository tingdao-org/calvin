<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>62.</strong><em>And ye shall be left few in number</em>. Since it had been promised to Abraham that his seed should be like the stars of heaven in multitude, it was a signal token of God’s wrath that his posterity should be reduced <span class="cite-ref">(252)</span> to so small a number; thus the comparison which is here made for the purpose of heightening their calamity, must not simply be referred to the “multitude” or great band, and the “fewness in number,” but must be extended to the promise, the truth of which had been clearly manifested; so that, on the other hand, they might perceive that their former populousness could only have been put an end to, like waters dried up by the excessive heat of the sun, through the wrath of God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(252)</span> “A une pongnee de gens;” to a handful of people. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
