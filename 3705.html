<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我从以色列人中拣选了利未人，代替以色列人一切头生的。利未人要归我。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And I, behold, I have taken the Levites </em>A little further on we shall see more clearly why God claims one tribe for Himself; He now only shews that the Levites rightfully belong to Him, because by special privilege the first-born of the people were preserved in the destruction of the Egyptians. God, therefore, declares that those, whose lives were thus gratuitously spared, were purchased to Himself. Since, then, He had the free option of devoting to Himself the first-born of every tribe, He was no less at liberty to take <span class="cite-ref">(425)</span> only the twelfth part of the people from one tribe. Thus He cuts off all handle for complaint, inasmuch as it would have been intolerable ingratitude to withdraw from His control those whom He had miraculously redeemed; therefore He says that they did not perish in the general slaughter, in order that tie might subject them to ttimself. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(425)</span> “Moins que la douzieme partie;” less than the twelfth part. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
