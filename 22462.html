<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">看哪，耶和华出令，大房就被攻破，小屋就被打裂。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This verse is added only to confirm the former sentence. The Prophet indeed intimates, that the common people, as well as the chiefs, in vain trusted in their quiet state; for the Lord would destroy them all together, from the highest to the lowest. <em>Behold, Jehovah, </em>he says, <em>commands etc</em>. ; by using the word commands, he means, that God had many reasons why he should take away and destroy them all. But he goes farther than this, and intimates that their destruction was dependent on the sole will of God; as though he said, “Though the Lord may not send for ministers of vengeance, though he may not prepare great forces, yet his word only, whenever it shall go forth, will consume you all.” We now then perceive what the Prophet means by the word “commands.” </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>He will smite the great house with confusions, </em>or, according to some, <em>with breaking </em><span class="lang he-il">רסס</span>, <em>resas, </em>means properly to mingle. The Prophet therefore, I doubt not, refers here to those dreadful falls which commonly happen to great and splendid palaces. When a cottage is overturned so great a ruin is not occasioned by its weight; nay, when its ruin begins to appear, fragments fall down one after another, so that the whole work falls without any violence. This, I say, is the case with small and common houses; but when there is a great building, its downfall is tremendous. I am therefore inclined to render the word “confusion,” and the difference between small and great houses will then be more evident. <em>Great houses </em>then <em>shall be smitten with confusions, </em>(<em>mixtionibus </em><em>, </em>with minglings) but small houses shall be smitten with fissures or clefts. But yet, as I have already reminded you, the Prophet means that there would be a ruin, both to the principal men and to the common people, so that they would all perish, from the least to the greatest. We hence learn how great was the corruption of that people; for God punishes none but the wicked. It then follows that equity was everywhere subverted and that all orders of men were become vicious and corrupt. It follows — </p></div>
