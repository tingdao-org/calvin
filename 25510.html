<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我有当受的洗。还没有成就，我是何等的迫切呢。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>50.</strong><em>But I have a baptism to be baptized with. </em>By these words our Lord asserts that there remains nothing but his last act, that by his death he may consecrate the renovation of the world. For since the shaking which he mentioned was appalling, and since that conflagration of the human race was terrific, he is about to show that the first-fruits must be offered in his own person, after which the disciples ought not to be displeased at feeling some portion of it. He compares death—as in other passages—to <em>baptism, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_6:4</span>,) because the children of God, after having been immersed for a time by the death of the body, shortly afterwards rise again to life, so that death is nothing else than a passage through the midst of the waters. He says that he is <em>sorely pressed till that baptism has been accomplished, </em>that he may encourage every one of us, by his example, both to bear the cross and to prefer death. Not that any man can have a natural preference for death, or for any abatement of present happiness, but because, when we contemplate on the farther bank the glory, and the blessed and immortal rest of heaven, we not only suffer death with patience, but are even carried forward by eager desire where faith and hope lead us. </p></div>
