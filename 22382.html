<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我却要降火在摩押，烧灭加略的宫殿。摩押必在哄嚷呐喊吹角之中死亡。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He therefore adds a threatening, <em>I will send a fire on Moab, which shall devour the palaces of </em><span class="lang he-il">קריות</span><em>, Koriut </em>We have stated that what the Prophet means by these modes of speaking is that God would consume the Moabites by a violent punishment as by a burning fire, that fortified places could not hinder him from executing his vengeance, and that though they were proud of their palaces, yet these would avail them nothing. </p><p>And he subjoins, <em>Moab shall die with tumult, with noise, with the sound of the trumpet; </em>that is, I will send strong enemies, who will come and make no peace with the Moabites, but will take possession of every place, and of fortified cities, by force and by the sword. For what the Prophet means by tumult, by shouting, by the sound of the trumpet, is, that the Moabites would not come under the power of their enemies by certain agreements and compacts, as when a voluntary surrender is made, which usually mitigates the hostile rage of enemies; no, he says, it shall not be so; for their enemies shall have not only their wealth but their lives also. </p></div>
