<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>93.</strong><em>I will never forget thy statutes. </em>This verse contains a thanksgiving. As the law of the Lord had preserved him, he engages that he will never forget it. Yet he, at the same time, admonishes himself and others how necessary it is to cherish in the heart the remembrance of the Divine Law; for though we have found from experience its life-giving power, yet we easily allow it to pass from our memories, and on this account God afterwards justly punishes us, by leaving us for a long time to languish in our sadness. </p></div>
