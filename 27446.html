<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">到了耶路撒冷，教会和使徒并长老，都接待他们，他们就述说神同他们所行的一切事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>They were received of the Church. </em>By this word <em>Church </em>he meaneth the multitude itself and the whole body; that done, he assigneth a peculiar place to the apostles and elders, by whom Paul and Barnabas were specially received. Furthermore, because the apostles had no certain place of abode at Jerusalem, but went ever now and then sometimes to one place and sometimes to another, whithersoever occasion did call them, that church had elders to whom the ordinary government of the Church was committed; and what the one function differeth from the other we have before declared, ( <span class="bvs">Act_14:23</span>.) And hereby it appeareth what brotherly courtesy there was in the apostles and elders, because they do not only courteously receive Paul and Barnabas, but so soon as they hear what success they had with their pains they took, they magnify the grace of God. Luke repeateth again that form of speech which we had before in the chapter next going before, when he saith, that they declared whatsoever things God had done with them. Wherein we must remember that which I said before, that God is not made a fellow-laborer, but all the whole praise of the work is ascribed to him. Therefore it is said, that he did that with Paul and Barnabas which he did by them, as he is said to deal mercifully with us when he helpeth our miseries.</p></div>
