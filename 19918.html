<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">犹大王宫里所剩的妇女必都带到巴比伦王的首领那里。这些妇女必说，你知己的朋友催逼你，胜过你。见你的脚陷入淤泥中，就转身退后了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Behold, the women who as yet remain in the palace of the king, shall go forth to the princes of the king of Babylon, </em>that is, having left the city they will betray thee to thine enemies; and they <em>shall say, The men of thy peace have deceived thee, </em>or persuaded thee, <em>and have prevailed; thus fixed in the mire are thy feet, and they have turned backward </em>There is here a part stated for the whole, for under one thing is included the whole calamity of the city. We indeed know that the female sex do not stand in the ranks to fight, and that when a city is taken, women are commonly spared. When, therefore, the Prophet says, <em>Go forth shall women who are yet remaining in the king’s palace, </em>it is the same thing as if he had said, “Even the women shall be compelled to go forth to the enemies, and give themselves up into their power; what then will become of the men, when such shall be the hard condition of the women?” </p><p>We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet: <em>Go forth then shall women, </em>that is, when the city is taken, the women in the palace shall be drawn forth from their hiding-places, and be constrained to appear before their enemies. And then he adds, <em>and, behold, they shall say, etc</em>. He used the particle <span class="lang he-il">הנה</span>, <em>ene, </em>twice, in order to lead Zedekiah into the very scene itself; for it is necessary thus to rouse those who are torpid in their apathy. <em>And, behold, </em>he says, <em>they will say </em>Here Jeremiah declares that women would be witnesses to bear testimony to the folly of the king, and also to the wickedness and obstinacy of the princes, as though he had said, <em>“Thou </em>wilt not obey me to-day, and thy counsel-lors also pertinaciously resist; God has already pronounced judgment on you: ye despise, and regard it as nothing: God will at length rouse up women, who will openly proclaim thy folly, O king, and the perverseness of thy counselors, for having despised all the prophecies.” </p></div>
