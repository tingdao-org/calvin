<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因我活着就是基督，我死了就有益处。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21</strong><em>For to me to live</em>. Interpreters have hitherto, in my opinion, given a wrong rendering and exposition to this passage; for they make this distinction, that Christ was life to Paul, and death was gain. I, on the other hand, make Christ the subject of discourse in both clauses, so that he is declared to be gain in him both in life and in death; for it is customary with the Greeks to leave the word <span class="lang el-gr">πρός</span> to be understood. Besides that this meaning is less forced, it also corresponds better with the foregoing statement, and contains more complete doctrine. He declares that it is indifferent to him, and is all one, whether he lives or dies, because, having Christ, he reckons both to be <em>gain</em>. And assuredly it is Christ alone that makes us happy both in death and in life; otherwise, if death is miserable, life is in no degree happier; so that it is difficult to determine whether it is more advantageous to live or to die <em>out of Christ</em>. On the other hand, let Christ be with us, and he will bless our life as well as our death, so that both will be happy and desirable for us. </p></div>
