<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">五人就走了，来到拉亿，见那里的民安居无虑，如同西顿人安居一样。在那地没有人掌权扰乱他们。他们离西顿人也远，与别人没有来往。</div></div>
