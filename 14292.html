<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">现在我得以昂首，高过四面的仇敌。我要在他的帐幕里欢然献祭。我要唱诗，歌颂耶和华。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And I will offer sacrifices of triumph </em><span class="cite-ref">(583)</span><em>in his tabernacle. </em>By making a solemn vow of thanksgiving, after he shall have been delivered from dangers, he confirms himself again in the hope of deliverance. The faithful under the Law, we know, were wont, by a solemn rite, to pay their vows, when they had experienced any remarkable blessing from God. Here, therefore, David, though in banishment, and prohibited from approaching the temple, boasts that he would again come to the altar of God, and offer the sacrifice of praise. It appears, however, that he tacitly sets the holy rejoicing and songs, in which he promises to give thanks to God, in opposition to the profane triumphings of the world. </p><p><strong>(583)</strong> “Sacrificia jubili.” —<em>Lat. </em>“<span class="lang fr-fr">Sacrifice de triomphe</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. <em>Ainsworth </em>reads, “Sacrifices of shouting, or of triumph, of joyful sounding and alarm.” “This,” says he, “hath respect to the law which appointed over the sacrifices trumpets to be sounded, <span class="bvs">Num_10:10</span>, whose chiefest, most loud, joyful, and triumphant sound was called <em>trughnah, </em>[or <span class="lang he-il">תרועה</span>, <em>truah, </em>the word here used,] ‘triumph,’ ‘alarm,’ or ‘jubilation,’ <span class="bvs">Num_10:5</span>.” </p></div>
