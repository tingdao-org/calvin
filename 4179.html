<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">祭司要为以色列全会众赎罪，他们就必蒙赦免，因为这是错误。他们又因自己的错误，把供物，就是向耶和华献的火祭和赎罪祭，一并奉到耶和华面前。</div></div>
