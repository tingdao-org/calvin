<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">祭司要察看肉皮上的灾病，若灾病处的毛已经变白，灾病的现象深于肉上的皮，这便是大麻疯的灾病。祭司要察看他，定他为不洁净。</div></div>
