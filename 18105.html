<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人必不得饮酒唱歌。喝浓酒的，必以为苦。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>They shall not drink wine with a song. </em>To drink wine is not in itself evil, because God has appointed it for the use of man; but here the Prophet describes the banquets of drunkards, which were full of licentiousness, songs, and insolence. Again, because they abused their enjoyment of plenty, he threatens them with want, which men almost bring upon themselves, when by their luxury they turn to a bad use the goodness of God. </p><p><em>Strong drink shall be bitter. </em>He adds, that if they drink wine, it will be “bitter” to them; because sorrow commonly deprives men of a relish both for what they eat and for what they drink. The meaning may be thus summed up, “Though they have abundance of wine, yet they will be deprived of the use of it, because they will feel such sorrow as shall take away all relish for it.” “Strong drink shall be <em>bitter</em>; ” that is, you shall no longer enjoy those pleasures and delights in which you have hitherto indulged. </p></div>
