<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">示巴女王听见所罗门的名声，就来到耶路撒冷，要用难解的话试问所罗门。跟随她的人甚多，又有骆驼驮着香料，宝石，和许多金子。她来见了所罗门，就把心里所有的对所罗门都说出来。</div></div>
