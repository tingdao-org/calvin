<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列阿，你是有福的。谁象你这蒙耶和华所拯救的百姓呢？他是你的盾牌，帮助你，是你威荣的刀剑。你的仇敌必投降你。你必踏在他们的高处。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29</strong><em>Happy art thou, O Israel. </em>He again exclaims that happy is the people, whose salvation is in God; and surely this is the only true happiness; for unless we ascend to the first cause of Salvation, all salvations, so to speak, are but transitory. And, since God had honored the Israelites alone with this privilege, their condition is here distinguished from the common lot of the whole human race. By the words <em>shield </em>and <em>sword </em>is meant a perfect defense, as much as to say, that no part of their armor was to be sought elsewhere. </p></div>
