<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">及至埃及全地有了饥荒，众民向法老哀求粮食，法老对他们说，你们往约瑟那里去，凡他所说的，你们都要作。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>55.</strong><em>Go unto Joseph</em>. It is by no means unusual for kings, while their subjects are oppressed by extreme sufferings, to give themselves up to pleasures. But Moses here means something else; for Pharaoh does not exonerate himself from the trouble of distributing corn, because he wishes to enjoy a repose free from all inconvenience; but because he hassuch confidence in holy Joseph, that he willingly leaves all things to him, and does not allow him to be disturbed in the discharge of the office which he had undertaken. </p></div>
