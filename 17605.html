<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我给我的良人开了门。我的良人却已转身走了。他说话的时候，我神不守舍。我寻找他，竟寻不见。我呼叫他，他却不回答。</div></div>
