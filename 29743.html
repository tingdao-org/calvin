And this refutes the error of those who understand this passage as referring to domestic servants. <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Des serviteurs domestiques, et non pas des diacres de l’Eglise</span>.” — “To domestic servants, and not to the deacons of the Church.” </p></div></div>
