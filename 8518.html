<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你却爱那恨你的人，恨那爱你的人。你今日明明地不以将帅，仆人为念。我今日看明，若押沙龙活着，我们都死亡，你就喜悦了。</div></div>
