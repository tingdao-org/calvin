<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>I am the bread of life </em>Besides what he formerly said, that he is the life-giving <em>bread, </em>by which our souls are nourished, in order to explain it more fully, he likewise repeats the contrast between this <em>bread </em>and the ancient manna, together with a comparison of the men. </p></div>
