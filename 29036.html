<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Behold, this third time </em>He commends his own deed, for which he had received a very poor requital from the Corinthians. For he says, that he refrained from taking their worldly substance for two reasons <em>first, </em>because he sought <em>them, </em>not their wealth; and <em>secondly, </em>because he was desirous to act the part of a father towards them. From this it appears, what commendation was due to his modesty, which occasioned him contempt among the Corinthians. </p><p><em>I seek not yours. </em>It is the part of a genuine and upright pastor, not to seek to derive gain from his sheep, but to endeavor to promote their welfare; though, at the same time, it is to be observed, that men are not to be sought with the view of having <span class="cite-ref">(931)</span> every one his own particular followers. It is a bad thing, to be devoted to gain, or to undertake the office of a pastor with the view of making a trade of it; but for a person to <em>draw away disciples after him, </em>(<span class="bvs">Act_20:30</span>,) for purposes of ambition, is greatly worse. Paul, however, means, that he is not greedy of hire, but is concerned only for the welfare of souls. There is, however, still more of elegance in what he says, for it is as though he had said: “I am in quest of a larger hire than you think of. I am not contented with your wealth, but I seek to have you wholly, that I may present a sacrifice to the Lord of the fruits of my ministry.” But, what if one is supported by his labors? Will he in that case seek the worldly substance of the people. <span class="cite-ref">(932)</span> Unquestionably, if he is a faithful Pastor, he will always seek the welfare of the sheep — nothing else. His pay will, it is true, be an additional thing; but he ought to have no other aim, than what we have mentioned. Woe to those, that have an eye to any thing else! </p><p><em>Parents for their children </em>Was he then no <em>father </em>to the Philippians, who supported him even when absent from them? (<span class="bvs">Phi_4:15</span>.) Was there no one of the other Apostles that was a <em>father, </em>inasmuch as the Churches ministered to their support? He did not by any means intend this; for it is no new thing for even parents to be supported by their children in their old age. Hence, those are not necessarily unworthy of the honor due to <em>fathers, </em>who live at the expense of the Church; but Paul simply wished to show from the common law of nature, that what he had done proceeded from fatherly affection. This argument, therefore, ought not to be turned in a contrary direction. For he did this as <em>a father; </em>but, though he had acted otherwise, he would, notwithstanding, have been a <em>father </em>still. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(931)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Que les Ministres ne doyuent pas cercher les hommes a ceste intention d’auoir, chacun des disciples a soy en particulier</span>;” — “That Ministers ought not to seek men with the intention of having, each <em>one, </em>disciples to himself peculiarly.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(932)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Est-ce pourtant a dire que vn tel cerche la substance du peuple</span> ?” — “Must we then say, that such a man seeks the worldly substance of the people?” </p></div></div>
