<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">凡灵不认耶稣，就不是出于神。这是那敌基督者的灵。你们从前听见他要来。现在已经在世上了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And this is that spirit of Antichrist </em>The Apostle added this, to render more detestable the impostures which lead us away from Christ. We have already said that the doctrine respecting the kingdom of Antichrist was well known; so that the faithful had been warned as to the future scattering of the Church, in order that they might exercise vigilance. Justly then did they dread the name as something base and ominous. The Apostle says now, that all those who depreciated Christ were members of that kingdom. </p><p>And he says that the <em>spirit of antichrist would come</em>, and that <em>it was already in the world</em>, but in a different sense. He means that it was already in the world, because it carried on in secret its iniquity. As, however, the truth of God had not as yet been subverted by false and spurious dogmas, as superstition had not as yet prevailed in corrupting the worship of God, as the world had not as yet perfidiously departed from Christ, as tyranny, opposed to the kingdom of Christ, had not as yet openly exalted itself, he therefore says, that it <em>would come</em>. </p></div>
