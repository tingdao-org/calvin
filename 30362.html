<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>Stablish your hearts</em>. Lest any should object and say, that the time of deliverance was too long delayed, he obviates this objection and says, that <em>the Lord was at hand</em>, or (which is the same thing) that <em>his coming was drawing nigh</em>. In the meantime, he bids us to correct the softness of the heart, which weakens us, so as not to persevere in hope. And doubtless the time appears long, because we are too tender and delicate. We ought, then, to gather strength that we may become hardened and this cannot be better attained than by hope, and as it were by a realizing view of the near approach of our Lord. </p></div>
