<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>The salutation, with my own hand</em>. Here again he provides against the danger, of which he had previously made mention — lest epistles falsely ascribed to him should find their way into the Churches. For this was an old artifice of Satan — to put forward spurious writings, that he might detract from the credit of those that are genuine; and farther, under pretended designations of the Apostles, to disseminate wicked errors with the view of corrupting sound doctrine. By a singular kindness on the part of God, it has been brought about that, his frauds being defeated, the doctrine of Christ has come down to us sound and entire through the ministry of Paul and others. The concluding prayer explains in what manner God aids his believing people — by the presence of Christ’s grace. </p></div>
