<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">既然如此，夫妻不再是两个人，乃是一体的了。所以神配合的，人不可分开。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>What God therefore hath joined. </em>By this sentence Christ restrains the caprice of husbands, that they may not, by divorcing their wives, burst asunder the sacred knot. And as he declares that it is not in the power of the husband to dissolve the marriage, so likewise he forbids all others to confirm by their authority unlawful divorces; for the magistrate abuses his power when he grants permission to the husband to divorce his wife. But the object which Christ had directly in view was, that every man should sacredly observe the promise which he has given, and that those who are tempted, by wantonness or wicked dispositions, to divorce, may reflect thus with themselves: “Who, art thou that allowest thyself to <em>burst asunder what God hath joined? </em>” But this doctrine may be still farther extended. The Papists, contriving for us a church separated from Christ the Head, leave us an imperfect and mutilated body. In the Holy Supper, Christ joined the bread and the wine; but they have dared to withhold from all the people the use of the cup. To these diabolical corruptions we shall be at liberty to oppose these words, <em>What God hath joined let not man separate </em></p></div>
