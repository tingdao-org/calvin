<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这是在约但河外，伯大尼，（有古卷作伯大巴喇）约翰施洗的地方作的见证。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>These things were done in Bethabara</em>. The place is mentioned, not only to authenticate the narrative, but also to inform us that this answer was given amidst a numerous assembly of people; for there were many who flocked to John’s baptism, and this was his ordinary place for baptizing. It is likewise supposed by some to be a passage across Jordan, and, from this circumstance, they derive the name, for they interpret it <em>the house of passage</em>; unless, perhaps, some may prefer the opinion of those who refer to the memorable <em>passage </em>of the people, (<span class="bvs">Jos_3:13</span>,) when God opened up a way for them in the midst of the waters, under the direction of Joshua. Others say that it ought rather to be read <em>Betharaba</em>. Instead of <em>Bethabara</em>, some have inserted here the name <em>Bethany</em>, but this is a mistake; for we shall afterwards see how near <em>Bethany </em>was to Jerusalem. The situation of <em>Bethabara</em>, as laid down by those who have described the country, agrees best with the words of the Evangelist; though I have no wish to dispute about the pronunciation of the word. </p></div>
