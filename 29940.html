<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">和妹子亚腓亚，并与我们同当兵的亚基布，以及在你家的教会。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And to Archippus our fellow-soldier</em>. He next adds “Archippus,” who appears also to have been a minister of the Church; at least, if he be the same person who is mentioned towards the conclusion of the Epistle to the Colossians, (<span class="bvs">Col_4:17</span>,) which is not at all improbable; for the designation — “fellow-soldier” — which he bestows on this latter individual, belongs peculiarly to ministers. Although the condition of a soldier belongs to all Christians universally, yet because teachers may be regarded as standardbearers in the warfare, they ought to be ready more than all others to fight, and Satan usually gives them greater annoyance. It is also possible, that Archippus attended and shared in some contests which Paul maintained; and, indeed, this is the very word that Paul makes use of, whenever he mentions persecutions. </p><p><em>And to the Church which is in thy house. </em>By employing these terms, he bestows the highest praise on the family of Philemon. And certainly it is no small praise of a householder, that he regulates his family in such a manner as to be an image of the Church, and to discharge also the duty of a pastor within the walls of his dwelling. Nor must we forget to mention that this good man had a wife of the same character; for she, too, not without reason, is commended by Paul. </p></div>
