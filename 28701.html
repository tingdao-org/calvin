<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>If therefore the whole Church come together </em>As they did not see their fault, in consequence of having their minds pre-occupied with a foolish and depraved desire, he tells them that they will be exposed to the scorn of the wicked or the unlearned, if any, on coming into their assembly, should hear them uttering a sound, but not speaking. For what unlearned person will not reckon those to be out of their right mind, who, in place of speech, utter empty sound, and are taken up with that vanity, while they were gathered together for the purpose of hearing the doctrine of God? This statement has much that is cutting: “You applaud yourselves in your own sleeve; but the wicked and the unlearned laugh at your fooleries. You do not, therefore, see what to the unlearned and unbelieving is <em>perfectly </em>manifest.” </p><p>Here Chrysostom starts a question’ “If <em>tongues </em>were given to unbelievers <em>for a sign, </em>why does the Apostle say now, that they will be derided by them?” He answers, that they are <em>for a sign </em>to fill them with astonishment — not to instruct them, or to reform them. At the same time he adds, that it is owing to their wickedness, that they look upon the sign as madness. This explanation does not satisfy me; for however an unbeliever or unlearned person may be affected by a miracle, and may regard with reverence the gift of God, he does not cease on that account to deride and condemn an unseasonable abuse of the gift, <span class="cite-ref">(849)</span> and think thus with himself: “What do these men mean, by wearying out themselves and others to no purpose? Of what avail is their speaking, if nothing is to be learned from it?” Paul’s meaning, therefore, is — that the Corinthians would be justly <em>convicted </em>of madness by the unbelieving and unlearned, however much they might please themselves. <span class="cite-ref">(850)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(849)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Le sot abus de ce don, quand on le met en auant sans raison et consideration</span>;” — “The foolish abuse of this gift, when they bring it forward without, reason and consideration.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(850)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En ceste faqon de faire</span>;” — “In this manner of acting.” </p></div></div>
