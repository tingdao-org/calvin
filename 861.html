<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>And now, when shall I provide for mine own house also? </em>He reasons, that when he had so long expended his labors for another, it would be unjust that his own family should be neglected. For nature prescribes this order, that every one should take care of the family committed to him. To which point the saying of Solomon is applicable, Drink water from thy own fountains, and let rivers flow to thy neighbors. <span class="cite-ref">(85)</span> Had Jacob been alone, he might have devoted himself more freely to the interests of another; but now, since he is the husband of four wives, and the father of a numerous offspring, he ought not to be forgetful of those whom he has received at the hand of God to bring up. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(85)</span>Et defluant rivi ad vicinos. The English version is different: “Drink waters out of thine own cistern; and running waters out of thine own well.” </p></div></div>
