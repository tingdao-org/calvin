<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">妇人就凭她的智慧去劝众人。他们便割下比基利的儿子示巴的首级，丢给约押。约押吹角，众人就离城而散，各归各家去了。约押回耶路撒冷，到王那里。</div></div>
