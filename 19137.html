Is there no hope of pardon?” God shews that they were past remedy — How so? He says, <em>Dost thou not see? </em>Here he refers the examination of the cause to his servant Jeremiah; as though he had said, “There is no reason for thee to contend with me; open thine own eyes, and consider how they have fallen; for <em>children gather wood, and fathers kindle the fire, </em>and <em>women knead dough.” </em>Some render the last words, “Women are busy with the paste;” but literally, “they set the dough, “<em>la paste </em>God intimates here shortly, that the whole people were become corrupt, as though they had wickedly conspired together, so that men, women, and children, were all led away into idolatry as by a mad impulse; for he speaks here only of their superstitions.
