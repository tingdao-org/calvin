<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>But the chief priests and elder’s persuaded the multitude. </em>The Evangelist points out the chief instigators of the wicked proceedings; not that the foolish credulity of the people, who were influenced by others, admits of any excuse; but for the purpose of informing us that they were not, of their own accord, hostile to Christ, but that, having sold themselves to gratify the priests, they forget all justice and modesty, <span class="cite-ref">(260)</span> as well as their own salvation. Hence we learn how pernicious is the influence of wicked men, who can easily turn in every direction, to all kind of wickedness, the giddy and changeful multitude. Yet we must attend to the design of the Evangelist, which was to show, that the death of Christ was so eagerly demanded by the voice of the people, not because he was universally hated, but because the greater part of them, ambitiously desirous to follow the inclination of their rulers, threw aside all regard to justice, and might be said to have sold and enslaved their tongue to the wicked conspiracy of a few. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(260)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Toute equité mosiste, et honnesteté</span> :” — “all justice, modesty, and propriety.” </p></div></div>
