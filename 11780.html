<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以上提名的那些人就站起，使被掳的人前来。其中有赤身的，就从所掠的财物中拿出衣服和鞋来，给他们穿，又给他们吃喝，用膏抹他们。其中有软弱的，就使他们骑驴，送到棕树城耶利哥他们弟兄那里，随后就回撒玛利亚去了。</div></div>
