<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">彼得起来，跑到坟墓前，低头往里看，见细麻布独在一处，就回去了，心里希奇所成的事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_24:12</span><strong>.</strong><em>And Peter arose, and ran to the tomb. </em>I have no doubt that Luke here inverts the order of the narrative, as may be readily inferred from the words of John, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:3</span>;) and, in my opinion, the word <em>ran </em>(<span class="lang el-gr">ἔδραμεν</span>) might justly be rendered as a pluperfect tense, <em>had run. </em>All who possess a tolerable acquaintance with Scripture are aware that it is customary with Hebrew writers to relate afterwards those occurrences which had been omitted in their proper place. Luke mentions this circumstance for the purpose of showing more strongly the obstinacy of the apostles ill despising the words of the women, when Peter had already seen the empty grave, and had been compelled to <em>wonder at </em>an evident proof of the resurrection. </p></div>
