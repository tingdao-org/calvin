<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">（大卫的诗，交与伶长。）耶和华阿，求你拯救我脱离凶恶的人，保护我脱离强暴的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>To the chief Musician, </em>etc. I cannot bring myself to restrict this Psalm to Doeg, as the great body of interpreters do, for the context will clearly show that it speaks of Saul, and of the counselors who ceased not to inflame the king — himself sufficiently incensed against the life of one who was a saint of God. Being as he was a figure of Christ, we need not wonder that the agents of the devil directed so much of their rage against him. And this is the reason why he animadverts so sharply upon their rancor and treachery. </p><p>The terms <em>wicked </em>and <em>violent </em>men denote their unwarranted attempts at his destruction without provocation given. He therefore commends his cause to God, as having studied peace with them, as never having injured them, but being the innocent object of their unjust persecution. The same rule must be observed by us all, as it is against violence and wickedness that the help of God is extended. David is not Multiplying mere terms of reproach as men do in their personal disputes, but conciliating God’s favor by supplying a proof of his innocence, for he must always be upon the side of good and peaceable men. </p></div>
