<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚伦一年一次要在坛的角上行赎罪之礼。他一年一次要用赎罪祭牲的血在坛上行赎罪之礼，作为世世代代的定例。这坛在耶和华面前为至圣。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And Aaron shall make an atonement. </em>We should observe here the correspondence between the two altars; for, as the Israelites were admonished that the sacrifices would not please God, unless all uncleanness were wiped away by pure and holy prayers, so also the altar of incense was purified by the sprinkling of blood, that they might learn that their prayers obtained acceptance through sacrifices. Although this was only done once a year, yet it was daily to be called to mind, in order that they might offer the death of Christ by faith and prayer, <span class="cite-ref">(153)</span> and yet might know that their prayers had no sweet savor, unless in so far as they were sprinkled with the blood of atonement. </p><p><strong>(153)</strong> “Ut fide et precibus adolerent mortem Christi.” —<em>Lat. “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Afin qu’en appliquant a eux la vertu de la mort de Jesus Christ par foy et prieres</span>;” in order that applying to themselves the virtue of the death of Jesus Christ by faith and prayers. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div>
