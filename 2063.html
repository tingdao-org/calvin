<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为六日之内，耶和华造天，地，海，和其中的万物，第七日便安息，所以耶和华赐福与安息日，定为圣日。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>For in six days the Lord made. </em>From this passage it may be probably conjectured that the hallowing of the Sabbath was prior to the Law; and undoubtedly what Moses has before narrated, that they were forbidden to gather the manna on the seventh day, seems to have had its origin from a well-known and received custom; whilst it is not credible that the Observance of the Sabbath was omitted, when God revealed the rite of sacrifice to the holy (Fathers. <span class="cite-ref">(334)</span>) But what in the depravity of human nature was altogether extinct among heathen nations, and almost obsolete with the race of Abraham, God renewed in His Law: that the Sabbath should be honored by holy and inviolable observance; and this the impure dogs <span class="cite-ref">(335)</span> accounted to be amongst the disgraces of the Jewish nation. </p><p><strong>(334)</strong> Added from <em>Fr. </em></p><p><strong>(335)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les payens, comme chiens mastins</span>;” the heathen, like dogs. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
