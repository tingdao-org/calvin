<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>And having been made free from sin, etc. </em>The meaning is, “It is unreasonable that any one, after having been made free, should continue in a state of bondage; for he ought to maintain the freedom which he has received: it is not then befitting, that you should be brought again under the dominion of sin, from which you have been set at liberty by Christ.” It is an argument derived from the efficient cause; another also follows, taken from the final cause, Ye have been liberated from the bondage of sin, that ye might pass into the kingdom of righteousness; it is hence right that you should wholly turn away from sin, and turn your minds wholly to righteousness, into the service of which you have been transferred.” </p><p>It must be observed, that no one can be a servant to righteousness except he is first liberated by the power and kindness of God from the tyranny of sin. So Christ himself testifies, </p><p>“If the Son shall free you, you shall be free indeed.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_8:36</span>.) </p><p>What are then our preparations by the power of free will, since the commencement of what is good proceeds from this manumission, which the grace of God alone effects? </p></div>
