<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说，我必使我所说的一切灾祸临到这城和属城的一切城邑，因为他们硬着颈项不听我的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The reason is subjoined, <em>Because they have hardened their neck</em>. He again confirms what we have before observed, — that they had fallen, not through ignorance, but through perverseness; for they had learned with sufficient clearness from the law what was right, and they had also been often warned by the prophets. Hence then their wickedness appeared and their untameable spirit, for they had heard the sound doctrine of the law, and had many to warn them. </p><p>Now this passage teaches us that there is no pardon left for us, when we, as it were, avowedly reject the yoke of God. And this ought to be carefully noticed, for we see how difficult it is to subdue men, even when they confess that the word of God is what they hear. Since then there is in all mankind an innate perverseness, that hardly one in a hundred allows himself to be ruled by God’s word, it behoves us seriously to consider what is here said, — that they are unworthy of mercy who harden their neck. Hence it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_95:8</span>, </p><p>“Harden not your hearts like your fathers.” </p><p>And a clearer definition follows, <em>That they might not hear my words</em>. Though there be hardness in all mortals, yet when the doctrine of salvation is made known and not received, then a greater impiety and pride shew themselves; for in that case, men hear God speaking, and yet rob him of his authority. It then follows, that the more clearly God makes known his truth, the less ground of excuse there is; for then especially comes to light the impiety of men, and their disdain seems incapable of being subdued. </p></div>
