<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们却羡慕一个更美的家乡，就是在天上的。所以神被称为他们的神，并不以为耻。因为他已经给他们预备了一座城。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Wherefore God is not ashamed, etc. </em>He refers to that passage, “I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” (<span class="bvs">Exo_3:6</span>.) It is a singular honor when God makes men illustrious, by attaching his name to them; and designs thus to have himself distinguished from idols. This privilege, as the Apostle teaches us, depends also on faith; for when the holy fathers aspired to a celestial country, God on the other hand counted them as citizens. We are hence to conclude, that there is no place for us among God’s children, except we renounce the world, and that there will be for us no inheritance in heaven, except we become pilgrims on earth; Moreover, the Apostle justly concludes from these words, — “I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,” that they were heirs of heaven, since he who thus speaks is not the God of the dead, but of the living. </p></div>
