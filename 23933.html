<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>For you devour widows’ houses. </em>He now proceeds farther, for he not only accuses them of open crimes which demand hatred and detestation, but even tears away the disguises of virtues, by which they deceived the common people. If it be objected, that there was no need of reproving those things which could do no harm by their example, we ought to recollect that it was impossible to promote the salvation of those who were held bound by the errors of the scribes, unless they turned away entirely from such persons. This reason, therefore, constrained Christ to expose the vain appearance of virtues, which nourishes superstitions. </p><p><em>And that under the pretense of a long prayer. He </em>says in general that, even when they appear to do what is right, they wickedly abuse the pretense of religion. <em>Long prayers </em>contained some evidence of remarkable piety; for the more holy a man is, the more eminently is he devoted to prayer. But Christ says that the <em>Pharisees </em>and <em>scribes </em>were so impure, that even the chief part of the worship of God was not used by them without committing sin, because constancy in <em>prayer </em>was with them, trap for base gain. For they sold their prayers in exactly the same manner as hirelings dispose of their daily labor. <span class="cite-ref">(97)</span> Hence also we infer that our Lord does not exactly reprove <em>long prayers, </em>as if in itself it were an impropriety—particularly since pastors ought to be eminently devoted to <em>prayer </em>—but to condemn this abuse, because a thing laudable in itself was turned to a wicked purpose. For when men aim at gain by means of hired prayers, the more fervent the appearance of what they call <em>devotion </em>becomes, the more is the name of God profaned. And as this false conviction had been long and deeply seated in the minds of the common people, on this account Christ employs harsher threatenings; for the pollution of so sacred a thing was no light offense. That it was chiefly <em>widows </em>that were imposed on need not excite surprise, because silly women are more prone to superstition, and therefore it has always been customary for base men to make gain of. them. Thus Paul brings a charge against the false teachers of his age, that they </p><p>lead captive silly women laden with sins, (<span class="bvs">2Ti_3:6</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(97)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que les mercenaires et ouvriers ont accoustumé de vendre leur labeur, et se loer à la journee</span>;” — “as hirelings and laborers are wont to sell their labor, and to hire themselves out for the day.” </p></div></div>
