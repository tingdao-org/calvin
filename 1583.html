<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And Moses said, I will now turn aside. </em>It is certain that his mind was disposed to reverence from no rashness, but by divine inspiration. Although not yet accustomed to visions, he still perceives that, this is no unmeaning spectacle, but that some mystery was contained in it, which he must by no means neglect, and to the knowledge of which he was divinely called. In this, too, we must observe his tractableness, in turning aside to learn. For it often happens that God presents himself to us in vain, because we presumptuously reject such great mercy. Let us learn, then, by the example of Moses, as often as God invites us to himself by any sign, to give diligent heed, lest the proffered light be quenched by our own apathy. But from his calling it a “great sight,” we gather that he was taught by secret inspiration the depth of the mystery, though it was as yet unknown. In this way God prepared his mind to reverence, <span class="cite-ref">(38)</span> that he might the sooner profit by it. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(38)</span> A humilite. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
