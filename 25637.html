<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_16:16</span><strong>.</strong><em>The Law and the Prophets were till John </em>Our Lord had said that the earnestness of the people was a prelude to those things which <em>the Prophets </em>had foretold as to the future renovation of the Church. He now compares the ministry of John to <em>the Law and the Prophets </em>“It is not wonderful,” he tells us, “that God should now act so powerfully on the minds of men; for he is not as formerly, seen at a distance under dark shadows, but appears openly and at hand for the establishment of his kingdom.” Hence it follows, that those who obstinately reject <em>John’s </em>doctrine are less excusable than those who despised <em>the Law and the Prophets </em></p></div>
