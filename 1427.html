<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">埃及地都在你面前，只管叫你父亲和你弟兄住在国中最好的地。他们可以住在歌珊地。你若知道他们中间有什么能人，就派他们看管我的牲畜。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>The land of Egypt</em>. This is recorded not only to show that Jacob was courteously received, but also, that nothing was given him by Joseph but at the command of the king. For the greater was his power, the more strictly was he bound to take care, lest, being liberal with the king’s property, he might defraud both him and his people. And I would that this moderation so prevailed among the nobles of the world, that they would conduct themselves, in their private affairs, no otherwise than if they were plebeians: but now, they seem to themselves to have no power, unless they may prove it by their license to sin. And although Joseph, by the king’s permission, places his family amidst the best pastures; yet he does not avail himself of the other portion of the royal beneficence, to make his brethren keepers of the king’s cattle; not only because this privilege would have excited the envy of many against them, but because he was unwilling to be entangled in such a snare. </p></div>
