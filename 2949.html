<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">摩西对亚伦和他儿子说，把肉煮在会幕门口，在那里吃，又吃承接圣职筐子里的饼，按我所吩咐的说（或作按所吩咐我的说），这是亚伦和他儿子要吃的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>And Moses said unto Aaron and his sons, Boil the flesh </em>This is the universal rule, as we have seen elsewhere. <span class="cite-ref">(411)</span> One thing only is special, that God kept them in the tabernacle seven days, that they might learn to subordinate all their domestic cares and worldly business to their sacred duties. It has been elsewhere said, also, <span class="cite-ref">(412)</span> that perfection is denoted by the number seven, which this passage confirms, for by the seven days they were reminded that they were no longer their own masters for the rest of their life. </p><p><strong>(411)</strong> See <em>ante, </em>vol. 2, p. 133. </p><p><strong>(412)</strong><em>Ibid., </em>p.26. </p></div>
