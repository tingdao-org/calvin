<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But if any man love God, the same is known of him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若有人爱神，这人乃是神所知道的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>But if any man loves God </em>Here we have the conclusion, in which he shows what is especially commendable in Christians, and even renders knowledge, and all other endowments worthy of commendation, if we <em>love God</em>; for if it is so, we will also love our neighbors in him. By this means all our actions will be properly regulated, and consequently approved by God. He shows, therefore, from consequences, that no learning is commendable that is not dipped in the <em>love of God</em>; because that alone secures, that whatever endowments we have are approved by him, as it is said in the second Epistle — </p><p>If any man be in Christ he is a new creature. <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_5:17</span>.) </p><p>By this he intimates, that without the Spirit of regeneration, all things else, whatever they may have of show, are of no value. To be <em>known by God </em>means to be held in any estimation, or to be reckoned among his sons. Thus he erases all proud persons from the <em>book of life</em>, (<span class="bvs">Phi_4:3</span>,) and from the roll of the pious. </p></div>
