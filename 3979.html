<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那洁净而不行路的人若推辞不守逾越节，那人要从民中剪除。因为他在所定的日期不献耶和华的供物，应该担当他的罪。</div></div>
