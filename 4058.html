<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">肉在他们牙齿之间尚未嚼烂，耶和华的怒气就向他们发作，用最重的灾殃击杀了他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>And while the flesh was yet between their teeth. </em>Moses does not specify any particular day; but only that God did not wait till satiety had produced disgust, but inflicted the punishment in the midst of their greediness. We may, however, conjecture from what precedes, that time was given them to gorge themselves. From whence their insatiable voracity may <em>be </em>gathered, which prevailed for so many continuous days, and could not be appeased by any quantity of food. God, therefore, allowed them time abundantly sufficient for them to gorge themselves, unless their gluttony was prodigious: and yet punished their intemperance, while the meat was <em>yet </em>in their mouths. They were, then, suddenly surprised in the midst of their guttling; and hence it is said in the Psalm, (<span class="bvs">Psa_78:30</span>,) “they were not <em>yet </em>estranged from their lust;” just as any glutton might choke himself, by devouring more than his throat could hold. Nor is that at variance with their repletion, of which mention was lately made; for, however the belly may swell with the quantity of its contents, the furious lust of eating is never appeased. But, in order that their punishment might be more manifest, God inflicted it in the very act; nor could any better opportunity have been chosen. </p></div>
