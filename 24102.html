<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">说话之间，那十二个门徒里的犹大来了，并有许多人，带着刀棒，从祭司长和民间的长老那里，与他同来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>47.</strong><em>While he was still speaking. </em>The Evangelists are careful to state that our Lord foresaw what happened; from which it might be inferred, that he was not dragged to death by external violence, except so far as wicked men carried into execution the secret purpose of God. Although, therefore, a melancholy and frightful spectacle was exhibited to the disciples, yet they received, at the same time, grounds of confidence to confirm them, since the event itself showed that nothing occurred by chance; and since Christ’s prediction directed them to contemplate the glory of his divinity. The circumstance of <em>an armed multitude </em>having been sent by <em>the chief priests, </em>and of <em>a captain and band </em>having been obtained by request from Pilate, makes it evident, that an evil conscience wounded and tormented them, so that they did every thing in a state of terror. For what need was there for so great a force to take Christ, who, they were aware, was not provided with any defensive arms? The reason for such careful preparation was, that the divine power of Christ, which they had been compelled to feel by numerous proofs, inwardly tormented them; but, on the other hand, it is a display of amazing rage, that, relying on the power of arms, they do not hesitate to rise up against God. </p></div>
