<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶户从那里前行，恰遇利甲的儿子约拿达来迎接他，耶户问他安，对他说，你诚心待我像我诚心待你吗？约拿达回答说，是。耶户说，若是这样，你向我伸手，他就伸手。耶户拉他上车。</div></div>
