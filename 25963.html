<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_23:27</span><strong>.</strong><em>And there followed him. </em>Although in public all the people, with one shout, had condemned Christ, yet we see that there were some who had not forgotten his doctrine and miracles; and thus, in the midst of that miserable dispersion, God reserved for himself a small remnant. And though the faith of those <em>women </em>was weak, yet it is probable that there was a hidden seed of piety, which afterwards in due time produced fruit. Yet their <em>lamentation </em>served to condemn the wicked and shocking cruelty of the men, who had conspired with the scribes and priests to put Christ to death But Luke’s design was different, namely, to inform us, that when the wickedness of men breaks out into unrestrained disorder, God does not indolently look on, to see what they are doing, but sits as a judge in heaven, to punish them soon for their unjust cruelty; and that we ought not to despise his vengeance, because he delays it till the proper time, but that we ought to dread it before he appears. </p></div>
