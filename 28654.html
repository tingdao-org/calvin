<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But now are they many members, yet but one body."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但如今肢体是多的，身子却是一个。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Many members </em>—<em>one body </em>He repeats this the oftener, because the stress of the whole question lies here — that the unity of the body is of such a nature as cannot be maintained but by a diversity of members; and that, while the members differ from each other in offices and functions, it is in such a way as to have a mutual connection with each other for the preservation of the one body. Hence no body can retain its standing without a diversified symmetry of the members, that we may know to consult public as well as private advantage, by discharging, every one, the duty of his own station. </p></div>
