<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们若把嚼环放在马嘴里，叫它顺服，就能调动它的全身。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>We put bits in the horses’ mouths</em>. By these two comparisons he proves that a great part of true perfection is in the tongue, and that it exercises dominion, as he has just said, over the whole life. He compares the tongue, first, to a bridle, and then to a helm of a ship. Though a horse be a ferocious animal, yet he is turned about at the will of its rider, because he is bridled; no less can the tongue serve to govern man. So also with regard to the helm of a ship, which guides a large vessel and surmounts the impetuosity of winds. Though the tongue be a small member, yet it avails much in regulating the life of man. </p></div>
