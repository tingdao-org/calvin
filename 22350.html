<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并将犹大人，和耶路撒冷人，卖给希腊人（原文是雅完人），使他们远离自己的境界。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>It follows, <em>And the children of Judah, and the children of Jerusalem, have ye sold to the children of the Grecians </em><span class="cite-ref">(14)</span>. There is here another complaint subjoined, — that the Syrians and Sidonians had been sacrilegious towards God, that they had cruelly treated God’s afflicted people. In the last verse, God inveighed against the Syrians, and Sidonians for having prostituted to their idols gold and silver stolen from him; he now again returns to the Jews themselves, who, he says, had been sold to the children of the Grecians; that is, to people beyond the sea: for as Javan passed into Europe, he includes under that name the nations beyond the sea. And he says, that they sold the Jews to the Greeks that they <em>might drive them far from their own borders, </em>so that there might be no hope of return. Here the cruelty of the Syrians and Sidonians becomes more evident; for they took care to drive those wretched men far away, that no return to their country might be open to them, but that they might be wholly expatriated. </p><p>We now perceive what the Prophet had in view: He intended that the faithful though trodden under foot by the nations, should yet have allayed their grief by some consolation, and know that they were not neglected by God; and that though he connived at their evils for a time, he would yet be their defender, and would contend for them as for his own heritage, because they had been so unjustly treated. He afterwards adds — </p><p><strong>(14)</strong><span class="lang he-il">לבני היונים</span>, to the children of the Ivanites, or Javanites. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
