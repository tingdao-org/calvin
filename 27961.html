<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Without the feelings of humanity </em>are they who have put off the first affections of nature towards their own relations. As he mentions the want of <em>mercy </em>as an evidence of human nature being depraved, [<span class="bvs">Augustine </span>], in arguing against the Stoics, concludes, that mercy is a Christian virtue. </p></div>
