<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">木匠拉线，用笔划出样子。用刨子刨成形状，用圆尺划了模样，仿照人的体态，作成人形，好住在房屋中。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>That it may abide in the house. </em>Thus he shews the folly of such intense application; for their toil brings no other reward than to see their idols resting indolently without motion in the position which has been assigned to them, just, as if a sluggard were crouching over a fire or reclining on a couch. </p></div>
