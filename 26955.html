<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这声音一响，众人都来聚集，各人听见门徒用众人的乡谈说话，就甚纳闷。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>When this was noised abroad. </em>Luke saith thus in Greek, <em>This voice being made; </em>but his meaning is, that the fame was spread abroad, whereby it came to pass that a great multitude came together. For if one after another in divers places, and at divers times, had heard the apostles speaking in divers tongues, the miracle had not been so famous; therefore they come altogether into one place, that the diversity of tongues may the better appear by the present comparison. There is a further circumstance also here to be noted, that the country (and native soil) of the apostles was commonly known, and this was also commonly known, that they never went out of their country to learn <span class="cite-ref">(86)</span> strange tongues. Therefore, forasmuch as one speaketh Latin, another Greek, another the Arabian tongue, as occasion was offered, and that indifferently, and every one doth also change his tongue, the work of God appeareth more plainly hereby. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(86)</span> “Ut peregrinas linguas discere potuerint,” so as to be able to learn foreign tongues. </p></div></div>
