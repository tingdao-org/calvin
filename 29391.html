<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30</strong><em>Having the same conflict</em>. He confirms, also, by his own example what he had said, and this adds no little authority to his doctrine. By the same means, too, he shews them, that there is no reason why they should feel troubled on account of his bonds, when they behold the issue of the conflict. </p></div>
