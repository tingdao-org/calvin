<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>They did not know that he spoke to them about the Father. </em>Hence we see how stupid those men are whose understandings are possessed by Satan. Nothing could be more plain than that they were summoned to the judgment-seat of God. But what then? They are altogether blind. This happens daily to other enemies of the Gospel; and such blindness ought to instruct us to walk with fear. <span class="cite-ref">(229)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(229)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A cheminer en crainte</span>.” </p></div></div>
