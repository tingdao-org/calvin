<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华如此说，这城必要交在巴比伦王军队的手中，他必攻取这城。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Then follows a confirmation, <em>Given up shall be this city into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and they shall take it </em>The Prophet shews the reason why he exhorted the Jews to flee, because the city would at length be taken. This is substantially what he says. </p></div>
