<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>The eyes of all who were in the synagogue </em>God touched their hearts, I doubt not, with astonishment, which made them more attentive, and induced them to listen to Christ, while he was speaking. For they must have been withheld from opposing this discourse at the commencement, or breaking it off in the midst, when they were sufficiently disposed, as we shall see, to treat Christ with contempt. </p></div>
