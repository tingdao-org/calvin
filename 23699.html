<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人若赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢？人还能拿什么换生命呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>For what doth it profit a man? </em>The word <em>soul </em>is here used in the strictest sense. Christ reminds them that the <em>soul </em>of man was not created merely to enjoy the world for a few days, but to obtain at length its immortality in heaven. What carelessness and what brutal stupidity is this, that men are so strongly attached to the world, and so much occupied with its affairs, as not to consider why they were born, and that God gave them an immortal soul, in order that, when the course of the earthly life was finished, they might live eternally in heaven! And, indeed, it is universally acknowledged, that the <em>soul </em>is of higher value than all the riches and enjoyments of the world; but yet men are so blinded by carnal views, that they knowingly and willfully abandon their souls to destruction. That the world may not fascinate us by its allurements, let us remember the surpassing worth of our <em>soul; </em>for if this be seriously considered, it will easily dispel the vain imaginations of earthly happiness. </p></div>
