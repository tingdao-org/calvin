<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">雅各就甚惧怕，而且愁烦，便把那与他同在的人口和羊群，牛群，骆驼分作两队，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And he divided the people</em>. Moses relates that Jacob formed his plans according to the existing state of affairs. He divides his family into two parts, <span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> and puts his maids in the foremost place, that they may bear the first assault, if necessary; but he places his free wives further from the danger. Hence indeed we gather, that Jacob was not so overcome with fear as to be unable to arrange his plans. We know that when a panic seizes the mind, it is deprived of discretion; and they who ought to look after their own concerns, become stupid and inanimate. Therefore it proceeded from the spirit of faith that Jacob interposed a certain space between the two parts of his family, in order that if any destruction approached, the whole seed of the Church might not perish. For by this scheme, he offered the half of his family to the slaughter, that, at length, the promised inheritance might come to the remainder who survived. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(102)</span> “Into two bands,” more literally, “into two camps or encampments;” <span class="lang he-il">לשני מחנות</span>, (<em>leshenai machanoth</em>). The word here used is the same in which the host of God is described in the second verse, and from which the name of the city Mahanaim is derived. — <em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
