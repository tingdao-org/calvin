<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在山顶蹦跳的响声，如车辆的响声，又如火焰烧碎秸的响声，好像强盛的民摆阵预备打仗。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Like the sound of chariots. </em>They expound <span class="lang he-il">מרכבות</span><em>merecabut</em>, chariots, though the Hebrews rather think them to be harnesses or saddles as we call them; but yet I prefer to view them as chariots; for what the Prophet says, that they <em>shall leap on the tops of mountains </em>like the sound of chariots, would not be suitably applied to the trappings of horses. They then shall leap on tops of mountains — but how? as chariots, that is, they shall come with great force, or make a great and terrible noise. And he speaks of the tops of mountains for there we know the noise is greater when there is any commotion. The Prophet, therefore, does in every way amplify God’s vengeance, that he might awaken the Jews, who by their indifference had too long provoked the Lord’s wrath. </p><p><em>Like the sound, he says, of the flame of fire, </em>or of a fiery flame, <em>devouring the stubble</em>. He compares the Assyrians to a flame, which consumes all things; and he compares the Jews to stubble, though they thought themselves fortified by many forces and strongholds. </p></div>
