<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这就是燔祭，素祭，赎罪祭，赎愆祭，和平安祭的条例，并承接圣职的礼，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>This is the law of the burnt-offering. </em>In this conclusion Moses indicates that full provision had been made lest any addition should insinuate itself from man’s inventions to vitiate the sacrifices. In the day, he says, that God appointed the sacrifices to be offered to Him on Mount Sinai, He omitted nothing which was to be observed, lest men should dare to introduce anything except what He prescribed. And surely, when He had thus carefully embraced all the ceremonies, we may easily infer from hence how earnestly we should avoid all temerity and audacity in invention. The design, therefore, of Moses was in this brief admonition to exhort the people to soberness, lest they should transgress the limits placed by God. </p></div>
