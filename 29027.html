<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">为这人，我要夸口。但是为我自己，除了我的软弱以外，我并不夸口。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Of such a man </em>It is as though he had said “I have just ground for glorying, but I do not willingly avail myself of it. For it is more in accordance with my design, to <em>glory in my infirmities </em>If, however, those malicious persons harass me any farther, and constrain me to boast more than I am inclined to do, they shall feel that they have to do with a man, whom God has illustriously honored, and raised up on high, with a view to his exposing their follies. </p></div>
