<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">既有人的样子，就自己卑微，存心顺服，以至于死，且死在十字架上。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>He became obedient</em>. Even this was great humility — that from being Lord he became a servant; but he says that he went farther than this, because, while he was not only immortal, but the Lord of life and death, he nevertheless became obedient to his Father, even so far as to endure death. This was extreme abasement, especially when we take into view the kind of death, which he immediately adds, with the view of enhancing it. <span class="cite-ref">(110)</span> For by dying in this manner he was not only covered with ignominy in the sight of God, but was also accursed in the sight of God. It is assuredly such a pattern of humility as ought to absorb the attention of all mankind; so far is it from being possible to unfold it in words in a manner suitable to its dignity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(110)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour amplifier et exaggerer la chose</span>;” — “For the sake of amplifying and enhancing the thing.” </p></div></div>
