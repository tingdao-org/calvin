<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又说，你不能看见我的面，因为人见我的面不能存活。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>And he said, Thou canst not see my face </em>Moses had indeed seen it, but in such a mode of revelation, as to be far inferior to its full effulgence. Long before the birth of Moses, Jacob had said, “I have seen God face to face,” (<span class="bvs">Gen_32:30</span>;) and to Moses, as I have lately shewn, a still clearer vision was vouchsafed. Now, however, he obtains something better and more excellent; and yet not so as perfectly to see God such as He is in Himself, but so far as the human mind is capable of bearing. For, although the angels are said to see God’s face in a more excellent manner than men, still they do not apprehend the immense perfection of His glory, whereby they would be absorbed. Justly, therefore, does God declare that He cannot be seen by a mortal man; for we shall not see him as He is, until we shall be like Him. (<span class="bvs">1Jo_3:2</span>.) For it must needs be that that incomprehensible brightness would bring us to nothing. God, therefore, whilst He withholds us from a complete knowledge of Him, nevertheless manifests Himself as far as is expedient; nay, attempering the amount of light to our humble capacity, He assumes the face which we are able to bear. </p></div>
