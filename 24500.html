<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>Then he enjoined them not to tell it to any person. </em>Many commentators torture these <em>injunctions </em>to an opposite meaning, as if Christ had purposely excited them to spread abroad the fame of the miracle; but I prefer a more natural interpretation which I have formerly stated, <span class="cite-ref">(424)</span> that Christ only intended to delay the publication of it till a more proper and convenient time. I have no doubt, therefore, that their zeal was unseasonable, when, though <em>enjoined </em>to be silent, they were in haste to speak. We need not wonder that men unaccustomed to the doctrine of Christ are carried away by immoderate zeal, when it is not called for. Yet what they unwisely attempted to do, was made by Christ to promote his own glory; for not only was the miracle made known, but the whole of that district, in despising the Author of heavenly gifts, was rendered inexcusable. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(424)</span> Harmony, vol. 1. p. 374. </p></div></div>
