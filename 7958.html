<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">撒母耳对扫罗说，你为什么搅扰我，招我上来呢？扫罗回答说，我甚窘急。因为非利士人攻击我，神也离开我，不再借先知或梦回答我。因此请你上来，好指示我应当怎样行。</div></div>
