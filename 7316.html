<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他一提神的约柜，以利就从他的位上往后跌倒，在门旁折断颈项而死。因为他年纪老迈，身体沉重。以利作以色列的士师四十年。</div></div>
