<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And led him away to Annas first. </em>The other Evangelists omit this circumstance, because it does not greatly affect the substance of the narrative; for nothing was done there that was worthy of being recorded. Perhaps the convenience of the place induced them to imprison Christ in the house of Annas, till the high priest assembled the council. </p><p><em>The high priest of that year. </em>He does not mean that the office of the high priesthood was annual, as many have falsely imagined, but that <em>Caiaphas was high priest </em>at that time, which appears plainly from Josephus. By the injunction of the Law, this honor was perpetual, and ended only at the death of him who held it; but ambition and intestine broils gave occasion to the Roman governors to dethrone one high priest and put another in his room, at their own pleasure, either for money or for favor. Thus Vitellius deposed Caiaphas, and appointed Jonathan, the son of Annas, to be his successor. </p></div>
