<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">埃及人要将这事传给迦南地的居民。那民已经听见你耶和华是在这百姓中间。因为你面对面被人看见，有你的云彩停在他们以上。你日间在云柱中，夜间在火柱中，在他们前面行。</div></div>
