<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>By the armor of righteousness </em>By<em>righteousness </em>you must understand — rectitude of conscience, and holiness of life. He employs the metaphor of <em>armor, </em>because all that serve God require to fight, inasmuch as the devil is always on the alert, to molest them. Now they must be completely armed, because, if he does not succeed in one onset, he thereupon makes a new attempt, and attacks them at one time from before, at another from behind — now on this side, and then on that. <span class="cite-ref">(593)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(593)</span> “Here the spiritual arms are not <em>particularized</em>; yet the terms <span class="lang el-gr">τῶν δεξιῶν καὶ ἀριστερῶν</span>, (<em>on the right hand and the left</em>,) are very <em>comprehensive</em>, referring to the complete armor and arms, on both sides, with which the <span class="lang el-gr">ὁπλίτης</span>, or <em>completely </em>armed soldier was furnished, who was thus said to be <span class="lang el-gr">ἀμφιδέξιος</span> (<em>ambidexter </em>.) Thus the general sense is: ‘We employ no other arms than the <em>panoply of righteousness</em>. ’” — <em>Bloomfield</em>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
