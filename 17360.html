<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神喜悦谁，就给谁智慧，知识，和喜乐。惟有罪人，神使他劳苦，叫他将所收聚的，所堆积的，归给神所喜悦的人。这也是虚空，也是捕风。</div></div>
