<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>Wherefore, brethren </em>This is the conclusion in connection with the principal question — that <em>prophecy </em>is to be preferred to other gifts, because it is the most useful gift of all, while at the same time other gifts ought not to be despised. We must observe, however, his manner of speaking. For he intimates, that <em>prophecy </em>is worthy of being eagerly and ardently aspired at by all. In the meantime, he exhorts them not to envy others the rarer gift, <span class="cite-ref">(892)</span> which is not so much to be desired; nay more, to allow them the praise that is due to them, divesting themselves of all envy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(892)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Autres, qui ont le don des langues, qui est vn don plus rare</span>;” — “Others, who have the gift of tongues, which is a rarer gift.” </p></div></div>
