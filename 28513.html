<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>I think therefore that this is good. </em>While I translate this passage of Paul’s writings differently from Erasmus or the Vulgate, I at the same time do not differ from them as to its meaning. They divide Paul’s words in such a way, that the same thing is repeated twice. I, on the other hand, make it simply one proposition, and not without authority, for I follow ancient and approved manuscripts, which make it all one sentence, with merely a <em>colon </em>between. The meaning is this: “I think it expedient on account of the necessity, with which the saints are always harassed in this life, that all should enjoy the liberty and advantage of celibacy, as this would be of advantage to them.” There are some, however, that view the term <em>necessity </em>as referring to the age of the Apostle, which was, undoubtedly, full of trouble to the pious: but he appears to me to have had it rather in view to express the disquietude with which the saints are incessantly harassed in the present life. I view it, therefore, as extending to all ages, and I understand it in this way, that the saints are often, in this world, driven hither and thither, and are exposed to many and various tempests, <span class="cite-ref">(418)</span> so that their condition appears to be unsuitable for marriage. The phrase <em>so to be</em>, signifies to remain unmarried, or to abstain from marriage. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(418)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Diuerses afflictions et orages</span>;” — “Various afflictions and tempests.” </p></div></div>
