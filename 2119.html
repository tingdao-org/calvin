<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人若在田间或在葡萄园里放牲畜，任凭牲畜上别人的田里去吃，就必拿自己田间上好的和葡萄园上好的赔还。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten</em>. This kind of fraud is justly ranked among thefts; viz., if any man shall have put in his beast to feed in another’s field or vineyard. For if a person have made improper use of his servant to steal by him, he himself is deemed guilty of the offense, even although he may have touched nothing with his own hand; nor does he less do wrong who has given occasion of injury by means of a brute. Still, God restricts the punishment to a compensation of double the amount, because it cannot be certainly established that the master of the animal desired to effect the damage fraudulently and designedly; yet He requires the loss to be made up at the highest estimate of its value; <span class="cite-ref">(138)</span> for thus I interpret “the goodness of his field and his vineyard,” that the place having been examined, a liberal restitution shall be awarded to its owner, according to the utmost it would have probably produced in its greatest state of fertility. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(138)</span><em>C.’s </em>view of these words seems to be adopted by none of the commentators. They understand them more simply, that the restitution was to be made in kind, and of the best of the aggressor’s produce. Whether we read with <em>C. </em>“bonum agri,” or with others “de bono,” or “de optimo,” as Dathe and <em>A. V</em>. , does not appear to affect this sense. </p></div></div>
