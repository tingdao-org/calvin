<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神原不是死人的神，乃是活人的神。因为在他那里，人都是活的。（那里或作看来）</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>For all live to him. </em>This mode of expression is employed in various senses in Scripture; but here it means that believers, after that they have died in this world, lead a heavenly life with God; as Paul says that Christ, after having been admitted to the heavenly glory, <em>liveth to God, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_6:10</span>) because he is freed from the infirmities and afflictions of this passing life. But here Christ expressly reminds us, that we must not form a judgment of the life of the godly according to the perceptions of the flesh, because that life is concealed under the secret keeping of God. For if, while they are pilgrims in the world, they bear a close resemblance to dead men, much less does any appearance of life exist in them after the death of the body. But God is faithful to preserve them alive in his presence, beyond the comprehension of men. </p></div>
