<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">不要听希西家的话，因亚述王如此说，你们要与我和好，出来投降我，各人就可以吃自己葡萄树和无花果树的果子，喝自己井里的水。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Do not listen to Hezekiah. </em>While he labors to turn away the hearts of the people from Hezekiah, he at the same time invites them to pleasures, that they may forget God and not expect anything from him. It is as if he had said, “Do not believe God, but rather believe my king.” Thus Satan deals with us; for, darkening the goodness of God by his clouds, and holding out to us the masks of false hope, he secretly and indirectly creeps into the place of God, or employs creatures to entangle us in his nets. He holds out pleasures, and some kind of more agreeable life, with this boast, “God shews it to you at a distance, I present it to you.” </p><p>Though Hezekiah is mentioned, yet the comparison is actually made between God and the king of Assyria; for Hezekiah, as he was the servant of God, made no false pretensions, and did not boast of any vain confidence, but, relying on true and most certain promises, faithfully exhorted the people to seek God; but Rabshakeh adorned his king by robbing God, and yet was the servant of Satan, to withdraw the people from confidence in God to all impiety. </p><p><em>Make with me a blessing. </em><span class="cite-ref">(41)</span> “To make a blessing” is to conduct themselves in a friendly manner; as if he had said, “Do not give any hostile indication, or risk a battle. Surrender, make your submission to my king.” Sennacherib does not merely demand that he shall be heard, but likewise that the people shall swear allegiance to hint; and, in order to allure them to him the more powerfully, he makes use of the word <em>blessing </em>as a cloak to that bondage which was in itself hateful. He bids them purchase a quiet life, and other conveniencies which they formerly enjoyed, by that miserable revolt; that is, by forsaking Hezekiah and going out to him; for to revolt from a pious king, whom God had appointed, and who was a type of Christ, was more wretched and miserable than anything else that could befall them, and could not take place without denying God himself, who had set up in Judea that token of heavenly favor. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(41)</span> “Make [an agreement] with me [by] a present, or seek my favor by a present. — Hebrews Make with me a blessing. — Eng. Ver. <span class="lang el-gr">εἰ βούλεσθε σὐλογηθὢναι</span> “if you wish to be blessed.” — <em>Sept. </em>“Come out to me for the sake of peace, and bless me, and bring me a peace-offering.” — <em>Jarchi. </em><span class="lang he-il">ברכה</span><em>(berachah,) blessing </em>is here figuratively used for <em>peace; </em>for since blessings commonly ran in this form, <em>Peace to thee, to you, </em>it appears that <em>peace </em>was called <em>blessing. </em>The Chaldee interpreter has therefore rendered it correctly, — <span class="lang he-il">עבדו עמי שלמא</span>, <em>(guabdu gnimmi shalma,) make peace with me.” </em>—<em>Rosenmuller. </em></p></div></div>
