<div class="CUV verse">所经过的路，便行残害暴虐的事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong>Very striking is the sentence that is added from Isaiah, <em>Ruin and misery are in all their ways; </em><span class="cite-ref">(102)</span> for it is a representation of ferociousness above measure barbarous, which produces solitude and waste by destroying every thing wherever it prevails: it is the same as the description which <em>Pliny </em>gives of<em>Domitian. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(102)</span><span class="bvs">Rom_3:15</span> are taken from <span class="bvs">Isa_59:7</span>. Both the Hebrew and the <em>Septuagint </em>are alike, but Paul has abbreviated them, and changed two words in the Greek version, having put<span class="lang el-gr">οξει᾿ </span> for <span class="lang el-gr">ταχινοι, </span> and <span class="lang el-gr">ἔγνωσαν </span> for <span class="lang el-gr">ὀίδασι, </span> and has followed that version in leaving out “innocent” before “blood.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
