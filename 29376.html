<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</div>
<div class="CUV verse">有的传基督，是出于嫉妒分争。也有的是出于好意。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>Some indeed</em>. Here is another fruit of Paul’s bonds, that not only were the brethren stirred up to confidence by his example — some by maintaining their position, others by becoming more eager to teach — but even those who wished him evil were on another account stirred up to publish the gospel. </p></div>
