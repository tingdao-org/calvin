<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>He was in the beginning</em>. In order to impress more deeply on our minds what had been already said, the Evangelist condenses the two preceding clauses into a brief summary, that <em>the Speech </em>always <em>was</em>, and that <em>he was with God</em>; so that it may be understood that <em>the beginning </em>was before all time. </p></div>
