<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若在他旁边忽然有人死了，以致沾染了他离俗的头，他要在第七日，得洁净的时候，剃头。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And if any man die very suddenly. </em>Here is prescribed what must be done, if a defilement should have been contracted which no precaution could have prevented. If a Nazarite should have willingly and knowingly entered a house of mourning, or should have come near a dead body, his consecration would have been violated not without, sin; but, in the case of a sudden death, the error was excusable, though God commands that it should be expiated; for whatever time of the vow had passed He counts for nothing, nor will it be taken into account. This was no light punishment, that he, who had been guilty of no fault, should begin to pay his vow altogether afresh. Besides the loss of the time, a sacrifice is also added, whereby he who was polluted should prepare himself for a new consecration. But, because this consecration was voluntary, none could complain of the immoderate rigor to which he had subjected himself of his own accord. Meanwhile, it was shewn how precious to God is the purity of His worship. <span class="cite-ref">(337)</span> Two Hebrew words from different roots, though they are of kindred signification, are used, by which mode of speaking Moses wished more fully to express the unexpected nature of the death. For, in my opinion, it is puerile of the Jews to understand the first of a bloody murder, the other of a sudden death. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(337)</span><span class="lang he-il">פתע פתאם</span> Each means <em>suddenly. A. V., very suddenly. </em>It is a rule of Hebrew Grammar that the use of two synonymous words is to be considered as a mode of expressing a superlative. — <em>W. </em></p></div></div>
