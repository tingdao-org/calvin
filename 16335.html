<div class="CUV verse">凡跌倒的，耶和华将他们扶持。凡被压下的，将他们扶起。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Jehovah upholding all the falling</em>. He gives instances of the goodness and mercy of God, such as make it evident that God reigns only for the promotion of the general welfare of mankind. By<em>the falling</em>, and <em>those who are bowed down</em>, he means figuratively those who are overwhelmed by adversity, and would sink at once, were not God to extend his hand for their support. God, in short, has respect to the troubles of men, and helps such as are in distress, so that all ought not only to look upon his divine government with reverence, but willingly and cordially submit themselves to it. Another lesson taught us is, that none will be disappointed who seeks comfort from God in his affliction. </p></div>
