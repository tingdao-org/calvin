<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这些事完了，保罗心里定意，经过了马其顿，亚该亚就往耶路撒冷去，又说，我到了那里以后，也必须往罗马去看看。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>He purposed in spirit. </em>His meaning is, that Paul purposed to take his journey through the instinct and motion of the Spirit; that we may know that all his whole life was framed according to God’s will and pleasure. And therefore hath he the Spirit to be the governor of his actions, because he did both give over himself by him to be ruled, and did also depend upon his government. Neither skilleth that which followeth, that he had not that success in his journey which he did hope for; for God doth oftentimes govern and rule his faithful servants, suffering them to be ignorant of the end.<span class="cite-ref">(381)</span> For he will have them so far forth addicted to him, that they follow that which he hath showed them by his Spirit, even shutting their eyes when matters be doubtful. Moreover, it is certain that he was wholly addicted to profit the churches, omitting and foreslowing [neglecting] his own commodity, in that he had rather deprive himself of Timotheus, a most excellent to him of all, most faithful, most dear, finally, a most fit companion, than not to provide for the Macedonians. </p><p><strong>(381)</strong></p><p>“ De exitu ipsos celans,” concealing the issue from them. </p></div>
