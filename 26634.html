<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">就离席站起来脱了衣服，拿一条手巾束腰。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And layeth aside his garments. </em>The meaning is, that he laid aside his <em>upper garment</em>, not his <em>coat</em>; for we know that the inhabitants of Eastern countries wore long <em>garments </em></p></div>
