<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">有风从耶和华那里刮起，把鹌鹑由海面刮来，飞散在营边和营的四围。这边约有一天的路程，那边约有一天的路程，离地面约有二肘。</div></div>
