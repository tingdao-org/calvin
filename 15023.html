<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">至于我，我的脚几乎失闪。我的脚险些滑跌。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>As for me, etc. </em>Literally, it is, <em>And I: </em>which ought to be read with emphasis; for David means that those temptations, which cast an affront upon the honor of God, and overwhelm faith, not only assail the common class of men, or those who are endued only with some small measure of the fear of God, but that he himself, who ought to have profited above all others in the school of God, had experienced his own share of them. By thus setting himself forth as an example, he designed the more effectually to arouse and incite us to take great heed to ourselves. He did not, it is true, actually succumb under the temptation; but, in declaring <em>that his feet were almost gone, </em>and that <em>his steps had well nigh slipped, </em>he warns us that all are in danger of falling, unless they are upheld by the powerful hand of God. </p></div>
