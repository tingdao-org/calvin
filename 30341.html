<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们这些淫乱的人哪，（淫乱的人原文作淫妇）岂不知与世俗为友，就是与神为敌吗？所以凡想要与世俗为友的，就是与神为敌了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>Ye adulterers</em>. I connect this verse with the foregoing verses: for he calls them <em>adulterers</em>, as I think, metaphorically; for they corrupted themselves with the vanities of this world, and alienated themselves from God; as though he had said, that they had become degenerated, or were become bastards. We know how frequent, in Holy Scripture, is that marriage mentioned which God forms with us. He would have us, then, to be like a chaste virgin, as Paul says, (<span class="bvs">2Co_11:2</span>.) This chastity is violated and corrupted by all impure affections towards the world. James, then, does not without reason compare the love of the world to adultery. </p><p>They, then, who take his words literally, do not sufficiently observe the context: for he goes on still to speak against the lusts of men, which lead away those entangled with the world from God, as it follows, — </p><p><em>The friendship of the world</em>. He calls it the friendship of the world when men surrender themselves to the corruptions of the world, and become slaves to them. For such and so great is the disagreement between the world and God, that as much as any one inclines to the world, so much he alienates himself from God. Hence the Scripture bids us often to renounce the world, if we wish to serve God. </p></div>
