<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们就对他们说，这是因为约旦河的水在耶和华的约柜前断绝。约柜过约旦河的时候，约旦河的水就断绝了。这些石头要作以色列人永远的纪念。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Then you shall answer them, </em>etc Although the stones themselves cannot speak, yet the monument furnished the parents with materials for speaking, and for making the kindness of God known to their children. And here zealous endeavors to propagate piety are required of the aged, <span class="cite-ref">(50)</span> and they are enjoined to exert themselves in instructing their children. For it was the will of God that this doctrine should be handed down through every age; that those who were not then born being afterwards instructed by their parents might become witnesses to it from hearing, though they had not seen it with their eyes. </p><p>The stones were placed according to the number of the tribes, that each might be incited to gratitude by its own symbol. It is true that two tribes and a half tribe who had obtained their inheritance beyond the Jordan, had not, when considered apart from the others, any occasion for making that passage. But as the land of Canaan was possessed by the others for the common good of the whole race of Abraham, so it behooved those who were all engaged in the same or a common cause not to be separated from each other. And although as yet mention had been made only of twelve men, it is obvious from a short clause, that the divine command had been declared to the whole people; for it is said that the children of Israel obeyed the words of Joshua. Nay, it is even probable that deputies were elected by suffrage to carry the stones in the name of the whole people. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(50)</span> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or ce passage est pour monstrer, que les gens anciens doivent etre affectionnez a la piete</span>;” “Now this passage is to show that the aged ought to be attached to piety.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
