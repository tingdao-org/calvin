<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>To psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs. </em>These are truly pleasant and delightful fruits. The <em>Spirit </em>means “joy in the Holy Ghost,” (<span class="bvs">Rom_14:17</span>;) and the exhortation, <em>be ye filled</em>, (ver. 18,) alludes to deep drinking, with which it is indirectly contrasted<em>. Speaking to themselves, </em>is <em>speaking among themselves. </em>Nor does he enjoin them to sing inwardly or alone; for he immediately adds, <em>singing in your hearts; </em>as if he had said, “Let your praises be not merely on the tongue, as hypocrites do, but from the heart.” What may be the exact difference between <em>psalms </em>and <em>hymns, </em>or between <em>hymns </em>and <em>songs, </em>it is not easy to determine, though a few remarks on this subject shall be offered on a future occasion. <span class="cite-ref">(163)</span> The appellation <em>spiritual, </em>given to these songs, is strikingly appropriate; for the songs most frequently used are almost always on trifling subjects, and very far from being chaste. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(163)</span> See Calvin Commentary on Philippians, Colossians, etc., page217. </p></div></div>
