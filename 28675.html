<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">等那完全的来到，这有限的必归于无有了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>When that which is perfect is come </em>“When the goal has been reached, then the helps in the race will be done away.” He retains, however, the form of expression that he had already made use of, when he contrasts <em>perfection </em>with what is <em>in part </em>“Perfection,” says he, “when it will arrive, will put an end to everything that aids imperfection.” But when will that perfection come? It begins, indeed, at death, for then we put off, along with the body, many infirmities; but it will not be completely manifested until the day of judgment, as we shall hear presently. Hence we infer, that the whole of this discussion is ignorantly applied to the time that is intermediate. </p></div>
