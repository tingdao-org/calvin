<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我岂没有吩咐你吗？你当刚强壮胆。不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。因为你无论往哪里去，耶和华你的神必与你同在。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Have not I commanded, </em>etc Although in Hebrew a simple affirmation is often made in the form of a question, and this phraseology is of very frequent occurrence, here, however, the question is emphatic, to give an attestation to what had previously been taught, while the Lord, by bringing his own authority distinctly forward, relieves his servant from care and hesitancy. He asks, Is it not I who have commanded thee? I too will be present with thee. Observe the emphasis: inasmuch as it is not lawful to resist his command. <span class="cite-ref">(24)</span> This passage also teaches that nothing is more effectual to produce confidence than when trusting to the call and the command of God, and feeling fully assured of it in our own conscience, we follow whithersoever he is pleased to lead. </p><p><strong>(24)</strong> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est bien pour certain avec grande signifiance que ceci se dit d’autant qu’il n’est pas question de resister a son commandement</span>;” “It is certainly with great significancy that this is said, inasmuch as there is no question of resisting his command.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
