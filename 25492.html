<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们这小群，不要惧怕，因为你们的父，乐意把国赐给你们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_12:32</span><strong>.</strong><em>Fear not, little flock </em>By this declaration our Lord strengthens the confidence to which he had exhorted his people: for how would God refuse worthless and perishing food to those whom he has adopted as heirs of his <em>kingdom? </em>And he expressly calls his own people <em>a little flock, </em>to hinder them from thinking that they are of less value in the sight of God, because, on account of their small numbers, they are held in little estimation before the world. The verb <span class="lang el-gr">εὐδοκεῖν</span> conveys the idea, that eternal life flows to us from the fountain of undeserved mercy. For the same purpose the word <em>give </em>is added. When Christ plainly declares, that God <em>hath given us the kingdom, </em>and for no other reason, but because it so <em>pleased </em>him, it is perfectly manifest, that it is not obtained by any merits of works. At whatever time the Lord raises our minds to the expectation of eternal life, let us remember, that we have no cause for fear as to daily food. </p></div>
