<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>That they may know thy way upon the earth. </em>Here we have a clear prophecy of that extension of the grace of God by which the Gentiles were united into one body with the posterity of Abraham. The Psalmist prays for some conspicuous proof of favor to be shown his chosen people, which might attract the Gentiles to seek participation in the same blessed hope. <span class="cite-ref">(4)</span> By the <em>way of God </em>is meant his covenant, which is the source or spring of salvation, and by which he discovered himself in the character of a Father to his ancient people, and afterwards more clearly under the Gospel, when the Spirit of adoption was shed abroad in greater abundance. <span class="cite-ref">(5)</span> Accordingly, we find Christ himself saying, </p><p>“This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_17:3</span>) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(4)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A fin que par la clarte d’icelle les Gentils soyent amenez a la participation de la mesme esperance</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(5)</span> “The petition here offered is, that the Gospel, God’s ‘way,’ might be universally spread; — a prayer that is not yet accomplished, but is in progress towards completion. The mention of nations and peoples, all of them, intimates, that the time which is the object of supplication is the time when God will no longer be the God of the Jews, but of the Gentiles also.” — <em>Walford</em>. </p></div></div>
