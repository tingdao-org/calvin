<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他就离开迦勒底人之地住在哈兰。他父亲死了以后，神使他从那里搬到你们现在所住之地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Then going out. </em>The readiness and willingness of faith is commended in these words. For when he is called he maketh no delay, but maketh haste <span class="cite-ref">(376)</span> and subdueth all his affections, that they may obey the holy commandment of God. It is uncertain for what cause he stayed at Charran; yet it may be that the weakness of his father caused him to tarry there, who, as we read, died there shortly after; or else, because he durst go no further, until such time as the Lord had told him whither he should go. It is more like to be true in mine opinion, that he was stayed there a while with the wearisomeness and sickness of his father, because Stephen saith plainly that he was brought thence after the death of his father. </p><p><strong>(376)</strong> “Non procrastinat, sed moras omnes rampit,” he does not procrastinate, but breaks off all delay. </p></div>
