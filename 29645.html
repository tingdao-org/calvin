<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24</strong><em>Faithful is he that hath called you</em>. As he has shewn by his prayer what care he exercised as to the welfare of the Thessalonians, so he now confirms them in an assurance of Divine grace. Observe, however, by what argument he promises them the never-failing aid of God — because he has <em>called </em>them; by which words he means, that when the Lord has once adopted us as his sons, we may expect that his grace will continue to be exercised towards us. For he does not promise to be a Father to us merely for one day, but adopts us with this understanding, that he is to cherish us ever afterwards. Hence our <em>calling </em>ought to be held by us as an evidence of everlasting grace, for he <em>will not leave the work of his hands incomplete</em>. (<span class="bvs">Psa_138:8</span>) Paul, however, addresses believers, who had not been merely called by outward preaching, but had been effectually brought by Christ to the Father, that they might be of the number of his sons. </p></div>
