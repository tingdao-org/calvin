<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">然而罪趁着机会，就借着诫命叫诸般的贪心在我里头发动。因为没有律法罪是死的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>For without the law, etc. </em>He expresses most clearly the meaning of his former words; for it is the same as though he had said, that the knowledge of sin without the law is buried. It is a general truth, which he presently applies to his own case. I hence wonder what could have come into the minds of interpreters to render the passage in the preterimperfect tense, as though Paul was speaking of himself; for it is easy to see that his purpose was to begin with a general proposition, and then to explain the subject by his own example. </p></div>
