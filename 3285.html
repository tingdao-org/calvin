<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们各人都当孝敬父母，也要守我的安息日。我是耶和华你们的神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Since this passage unquestionably relates to the explanation of the Fifth Commandment, it confirms what I have before shown, that the honor which God-commands to be paid to parents, does not consist in reverence only, but also embraces obedience. For the reverence which He now prescribes will render children submissive and compliant. Now, then, we more clearly understand how parents are to be honored, when God exhorts their children to beware of offending them; for this is, in a word, the true manifestation of filial piety, calmly to bear the yoke of subjection, and to prove by acts a sincere desire to obey. </p></div>
