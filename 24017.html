<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">愚拙的对聪明的说，请分点油给我们。因为我们的灯要灭了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And the foolish said to the wise. </em>This is a reproof of the late repentance of those who never think of what they are in want of, till <em>the door is shut </em>against every remedy. For those who do not make provision for a long period are charged with folly, because they are careless, and flatter themselves amidst their poverty, and allow the season of mutual intercourse to pass in such a way as to despise the aids which were offered to them. As they do not, in proper time, bethink themselves about procuring oil, Christ, mocking the knowledge which they have acquired when it is too late, shows how their stupidity will be punished, when they shall see themselves to be empty and unprovided, while there is no remedy. </p></div>
