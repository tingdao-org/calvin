<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>The multitude must needs come together. </em>The verb is a verb neuter, as if they should say, the multitude must of necessity come together. For it had been an absurd thing that an apostle, of such rare report, should not come before the whole multitude of the faithful. For if he had eschewed the light and sight of people, the sinister suspicion might have been increased. Nevertheless, we see how modestly the elders behaved themselves in nourishing concord, when as they prevent the offense of the people in time, saving that they bear too much<span class="cite-ref">(475)</span> peradventure with their infirmity, in requiring a vow of Paul. But this moderation must be kept in the Church, that the pastors be in great authority, and yet that they rule not proudly as lords, neither despise the rest of the body. For the distinction of orders, which is the bond of peace, ought not to be any cause of dissension.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(475)</span></p><p>“ Nimis indulgent,” are too indulgent to. </p></div></div>
