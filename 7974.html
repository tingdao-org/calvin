<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚吉叫大卫来，对他说，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你是正直人。你随我在军中出入，我看你甚好。自从你投奔我到如今，我未曾见你有什么过失。只是众首领不喜悦你。</div></div>
