<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们说，百夫长哥尼流是个义人，敬畏神，为犹太通国所称赞，他蒙一位圣天使指示，叫他请你到他家里去，听你的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Cornelius, a just man. </em>Cornelius’ servants commend their master not ambitiously, or to the end they may flatter him, but that Peter may the less abhor his company. <span class="cite-ref">(674)</span> And for this cause they say that he was approved of the Jews, that Peter may know that he was not estranged from true and sincere godliness. For even those which were superstitious, though they served idols, did boast that they were worshippers of God. But Cornelius could not have the Jews, who retained the worship of the true God alone, to be witnesses of his godliness, unless he had professed that he worshipped the God of Abraham with them. Furthermore, as this was a rare example, so it ought to have moved Peter not a little. Although they lean most of all to this argument, that they may persuade him that which they go about, that all this matter is governed by the commandment of God, as if they should say, That he is not so much called by a mortal man as by God, who had so commanded by his angel. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(674)</span> “Ab ejus congressu minus abhorreat,” may be less averse to meet with him. </p></div></div>
