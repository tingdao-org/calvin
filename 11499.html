<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚撒听见这话和俄德儿子先知亚撒利雅的预言，就壮起胆来，在犹大，便雅悯全地，并以法莲山地所夺的各城，将可憎之物尽都除掉，又在耶和华殿的廊前重新修筑耶和华的坛。</div></div>
