<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我心也大大地惊惶。耶和华阿，你要到几时才救我呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And thou, O Jehovah, how long? </em>This elliptical form of expression serves to express more strongly the vehemence of grief, which not only holds the minds of men bound up, but likewise their tongues, breaking and cutting short their speech in the middle of the sentence. The meaning, however, in this abrupt expression is doubtful. Some, to complete the sentence, supply the words, <em>Wilt thou afflict me, or continue to chasten me </em>? Others read, <em>How long wilt thou delay thy mercy </em>? But what is stated in the next verse shows that this second sense is the more probable, for he there prays to the Lord to look upon him with an eye of favor and compassion. He, therefore, complains that God has now forsaken him, or has no regard to him, just as God seems to be far of from us whenever his assistance or grace does not actually manifest itself in our behalf. God, in his compassion towards us, permits us to pray to him to make haste to succor us; but when we have freely complained of his long delay, that our prayers or sorrow, on this account, may not pass beyond bounds we must submit our case entirely to his will, and not wish him to make greater haste than shall seem good to him. </p></div>
