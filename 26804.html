<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>The high priest then asked Jesus. The high priest </em>interrogates Christ, as if he had been some seditious person, who had split the Church into parties by collecting <em>disciples; </em>and he interrogates him as if he had been a false prophet, who had endeavored to corrupt the purity of the faith by new and perverse <em>doctrines. </em>Our Lord <span class="cite-ref">(140)</span> Jesus Christ, having completely and faithfully discharged the office of teacher, does not enter into a new defense; but, that he may not abandon the cause of truth, he shows that he was prepared to defend all that <em>he had taught. </em>Yet he likewise reproves the impudence of the high priest, who inquires about a matter perfectly well known, as if it had been doubtful. Not satisfied with having rejected the Redeemer offered, together with the salvation promised to them, they likewise condemn all the exposition of the Law. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(140)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Nostre Seigneur</span>.” </p></div></div>
