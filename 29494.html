The <em>second </em>has more strength, inasmuch as he mentions that the power of God shines forth in his ministry. He does not speak, however, merely of the success of his preaching, (though in that too the blessing of God appears,) but also of the efficacy of the Spirit, in which God manifestly shewed himself; for on good grounds he ascribes his endeavors, inasmuch as they exceeded human limits, to the power of God, which, he declares, is seen <em>working powerfully </em>in this matter. </p><p><strong>(344)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Son travaille et peine</span>;” — “His labor and trouble.” </p></div>
