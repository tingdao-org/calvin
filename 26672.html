<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And whither I go you know. </em>As we need no ordinary fortitude, that we may patiently endure to be so long separated from Christ, he adds another confirmation, that the disciples <em>know </em>that his death is not a destruction, but a passage to the Father; and next, that they <em>know the way </em>which they must <em>follow</em>, that they may arrive at the participation of the same glory. Both clauses ought to be carefully observed. First, we must see Christ, by the eyes of faith, in the heavenly glory and a blessed immortality; and, secondly, we ought to know that he is the first-fruits of our life, and that <em>the way </em>which was closed against us has been opened by him. </p></div>
