<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">有人预先埋伏在妇人的内室里。妇人说，参孙哪。非利士人拿你来了。参孙就挣断绳子，如挣断经火的麻线一般。这样，他力气的根由人还是不知道。</div></div>
