<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我吩咐他们说，等到太阳上升才可开耶路撒冷的城门。人尚看守的时候就要关门上闩。也当派耶路撒冷的居民，各按班次看守自己房屋对面之处。</div></div>
