<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">腓立比人哪，你们也知道我初传福音，离了马其顿的时候，论到授受的事，除了你们以外，并没有别的教会供给我。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>And ye know </em>I understand this to have been added by way of excuse, inasmuch as he often received something from them, for if the other Churches had discharged their duty, it might have seemed as though he were too eager to receive. Hence in clearing himself he praises them, and in praising them he modestly excuses others. We must also, after Paul’s example, take heed lest the pious, on seeing us too much inclined to receive from others, should on good grounds reckon us to be insatiable. <em>You also know, </em>says he. <em>“I </em>do not require to call in other witnesses, for ye yourselves also know.” For it frequently happens, that when one thinks that others are deficient in duty, he is the more liberal in giving assistance. Thus the liberality of some escapes the notice of others. </p><p><em>In the matter of giving and receiving </em>He alludes to pecuniary matters, in which there are two parts, the one <em>receiving, </em>the other <em>expending. </em>It is necessary that these should be brought to an equality by mutual compensation. There was an account of this nature carried on between Paul and the Churches. <span class="cite-ref">(251)</span> While Paul administered the gospel to them, there was an obligation devolving upon them in return for supplying what was necessary for the support of his life, as he says elsewhere, </p><p>If we dispense to you spiritual thinqs, is it a great matter if you give in return carnal things? (<span class="bvs">1Co_9:11</span>.) </p><p>Hence, if the other churches had relieved Paul’s necessities, they would have been giving nothing gratuitously, but would have been simply paying their debt, for they ought to have acknowledged themselves indebted to him for the gospel. This, however, he acknowledges, had not been the case, inasmuch as they had not laid out anything on his account. What base ingratitude, and how very unseemly, to treat such an Apostle with neglect, to whom they knew themselves to be under obligation beyond their power to discharge! On the other hand, how great the forbearance of this holy man, to bear with their inhumanity with so much gentleness and indulgence, as not to make use of one sharp word by way of accusing them! </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(251)</span><em>“ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">Il y auoit quelque telle condition et conuenance entre Sainct Paul et les Eglises</span>;” — “There was some such condition and correspondence between St. Paul and the Churches.” </p></div></div>
