<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他父母说，在你弟兄的女儿中，或在本国的民中，岂没有一个女子，何至你去在未受割礼的非利士人中娶妻呢？参孙对他父亲说，愿你给我娶那女子，因我喜悦她。</div></div>
