<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And on the morrow. </em>Agrippa and his sister do not come like humble disciples of Christ, but they bring with them such pomp and gorgeousness as may stop their ears and blind their eyes; and it is to be thought that like haughtiness of mind was joined with that gorgeous and great pomp. No marvel, therefore, if they were not brought to obey Christ. Notwithstanding, it seemeth that Luke maketh mention of the pomp, that we might know that, in a great assembly, and before choice witnesses, whose authority was great, Paul had leave granted not only to plead his matter as a party defendant, but also to preach the gospel. For he cometh forth as in the person of a teacher, that he may set forth the name of Christ. So that the truth of God brake out of his bands, which was forthwith spread abroad everywhere with a free course; yea, it came even unto us. By this word <span class="lang el-gr">φαντασια</span>, Luke understandeth that which we call commonly preparation or pomp.<span class="cite-ref">(607)</span> But there must other furniture be brought unto the spiritual marriage of Jesus Christ.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(607)</span></p><p>“ Apparentiam,” show. </p></div></div>
