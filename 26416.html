<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>Now the slave remaineth not in the house always. </em>He adds a comparison, taken from the laws and from political law, to the effect that <em>a slave</em>, though he may have power for a time, yet is not the heir of the house; from which he infers that there is no perfect and durable<em>freedom</em>, but what is obtained through<em>the Son </em>In this manner he accuses the Jews of vanity, because they hold but a mask instead of the reality; for, as to their being <em>Abraham </em>’<em>s offspring</em>, they were nothing but a mask. They held a place in the Church of God, but such a place as Ishmael, <em>a slave</em>, rising up against his <em>freeborn </em>brother, usurped for a short time, (<span class="bvs">Gal_4:29</span>.) The conclusion is, that all who boast of being <em>Abraham </em>’<em>s children </em>have nothing but an empty and deceitful pretense. </p></div>
