<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所罗门照着他父大卫所定的例，派定祭司的班次，使他们各供己事，又使利未人各尽其职，赞美耶和华，在祭司面前作每日所当作的。又派守门的按着班次看守各门，因为神人大卫是这样吩咐的。</div></div>
