<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said </em>Inasmuch as this judgment of God was terrible, lest the Israelites should altogether fall into despair, Moses addresses a consolation to them to calm their sorrow, promising that he will make entreaty to God in their behalf. Meanwhile, in order that they might betake themselves as humble suppliants to God’s mercy, he reminds them of the enormity of their sin. The Hebrew words literally mean, <span class="cite-ref">(352)</span> ye have sinned a great sin; there is, however, no ambiguity in the sense; for he would humble them by setting the greatness of their crime before them, in order that they may earnestly give themselves to repentance. To the same effect is <span class="cite-ref">(353)</span> the particle <span class="lang he-il">אולי</span><em>, auli, </em>which is often used to express uncertainty, but here, as in many other places, only denotes difficulty; lest, as is frequently the case, they should think of asking pardon unconcernedly and carelessly, and not with anxious earnestness. Thus, when Peter addresses Simon Magus, he bids him pray, “if perhaps” his iniquity may be forgiven him, ( <span class="bvs">Act_8:22</span>;) not that he should vacillate or waver in his mind like those who are in suspense or doubt, but that terrified by the fear of God’s wrath, he should anxiously seek after the remedy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(352)</span> So <em>A.V. </em>It will be seen that <em>C</em>. renders the nouns in the ablative case, Ye have sinued <em>by </em>a great sin. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(353)</span> See <em>C</em>. on <span class="bvs">Amo_5:15</span>. — Minor Prophets, Cal.
