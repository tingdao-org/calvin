<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣将这比喻告诉他们。但他们不明白所说的是什么意思。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>This parable. </em>This is the reason why, proudly vaunting of their wisdom, they rejected the light of Christ; for in a matter not very obscure they are exceedingly dull of apprehension. </p><p><em>But they did not understand what things they were which he spoke to them. </em>In this clause the Greek manuscripts differ. Some copies might be literally rendered, <em>they did not understand what he said </em>Another reading, which I have followed, is more full, though it amounts to the same meaning. The third reading is, that <em>they did not know that he who spoke of himself was the Son of God</em>; but this is not much approved. </p></div>
