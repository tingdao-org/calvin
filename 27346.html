<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">彼得就出来跟着他，不知道天使所作是真的，只当见了异象。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>He knew not that it was true. </em>He did not think that it was a vain or false visor, as Satan doth oftentimes delude men with jugglings; but<em>true </em>is taken in this place for that which is done naturally and after the manner of men. For we must note the contrariety [antithesis] that is between the thing itself and the vision. Furthermore, though he think that it is a vision, yet doth he willingly obey; whereby his obedience is proved, whilst that being content with the commandment of the angel alone, he doth not inquire nor reason what he must de, but doth that which he is commanded to do. </p></div>
