<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华说，到那日我必拯救你，你必不至交在你所怕的人手中。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds, <em>But I will deliver thee in that day, and thou shalt not be given up into the hand of the men whose face thou fearest </em>Here God promises that Ebedmelech would be saved through a special privilege; and the Prophet shews that this prophecy had not been without reason announced. For though Ebedmelech had, with an intrepid mind, undertaken the cause of Jeremiah, and boldly and perseveringly fronted all reproaches, he yet was not divested of all the feelings of nature, but he had his fears, especially when he saw the cause of fear set before him. Hence the Prophet says, that he <em>feared </em>the face of enemies: and this might, at the same time, avail to rouse him to receive with more alacrity, the promise offered to him; for we know that the blessings of God are, in a manner, deemed of no value by us, when we do not know how necessary to us they are. The prophecies and the promises, by which God comforts us and animates us to patience, are for the most part viewed as of no worth, until God really shews to us how miserable we must be, except he thus succors us. Then the Prophet wished to remind Ebedmelech of this, when he said that he <em>feared. Thou fearest, </em>he says. For if Ebedmelech had no fear, he might have disregarded this prophecy as being superfluous. But being reminded of his fear and anxiety, he became more ready to receive what God promised to him. </p></div>
