<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣说，这话不是人都能领受的。惟独赐给谁，谁才能领受。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>All are not capable of receiving this saying. </em>By this he means, that the choice is not placed in our hands, as if we were to deliberate on a matter submitted to us. If any man thinks it advantageous for him to want a wife, and, without making any inquiry, lays upon himself an obligation to celibacy, <span class="cite-ref">(606)</span> he is widely mistaken. God, who has declared it to be good that a man should have a woman to be his helper, will punish the contempt of his own appointment; for mortals take too much on themselves, when they endeavor to exempt themselves from the heavenly calling. But Christ proves that it is not free to all to make what choice they please, because the gift of continence is a special gift; for when he says <em>that all are not capable of receiving it, but those to whom it is given</em>, he plainly shows that it was not given to all. And this reproves the pride of those who do not hesitate to claim for themselves what Christ so manifestly refuses to them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(606)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S’il s’astreigne a n’estre point marie</span>;” — “if he bind himself not to be married.” </p></div></div>
