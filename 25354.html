<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">便打发使者在他前头走。他们到了撒玛利亚的一个村庄，要为他预备。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>52.</strong><em>And he sent messengers. </em>It is probable that our Lord was, at that time, attended by a great multitude of followers; for the <em>messengers </em>were not <em>sent </em>to prepare a splendid banquet, or to select some magnificent palace, but only to tell that a vast number of guests were approaching. They again, when excluded and repulsed, wait for their Master. Hence, too, we learn, what I remarked in the second place, <span class="cite-ref">(588)</span> that when men differ among themselves about the doctrines of religion, they readily break out into hatred of each other; for it was an evidence of very bitter hatred to withhold food from the hungry, and lodging from those who were fatigued. But the Samaritans have such a dislike and enmity at the Jewish religion, that they look upon all who follow it as unworthy of any kindness. Perhaps, too, they were tormented with vexation at being despised; for they knew that their temple was detested by the Jews as profane, and that they were considered to be spurious and corrupt worshippers of God. But as the superstition once admitted kept so firm a hold of them, they strove, with wicked emulation, to maintain it to the last. At length the contention grew so hot, that it consumed both nations in one conflagration; for Josephus assures us that it was the torch which kindled the Jewish war. Now though Christ might easily have avoided that dislike, he chooses rather to profess himself to be a Jew, than by an indirect denial to procure a lodging. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(588)</span> See our Author’s observations above on <span class="bvs">Luk_9:51</span>. </p></div></div>
