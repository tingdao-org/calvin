<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>By the way that he came shall he return. </em>We have formerly explained what it is to return by the same way, that is, to depar without having accomplished anything, as we commonly say, (<em>Il s’en est retourne comme il est venu,) </em>“he returned as he came,” when nothing has been accomplished, and the efforts are unsuccessful. To confirm this, he adds, that “thus hath the Lord spoken;” for as soon as he “who cannot lie” (<strong>Titus 1:2</strong>) hath spoken, we ought to embrace and kiss his word, as if the result were rendered certain by the removal of every obstruction. </p></div>
