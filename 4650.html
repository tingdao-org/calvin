<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">摩西晓谕以色列各支派的首领说，耶和华所吩咐的乃是这样，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>And Moses spake. </em>Moses teaches in this chapter that the vows which were made by persons who were not free, were not held good before God; and although no mention is made of male children, still, as their condition was the same, it seems that by <em>synecdoche </em>they must be included with the daughters and wives, unless perhaps God chose to pay regard to the weaker sex. But since He permits females, who were not under their father’s power, to make vows in spite of their sex, nor does He make it to be an excuse for levity or thoughtlessness, it seems that the object proposed was, that the right of the father over his children as well as of the husband over the wife, should be maintained inviolate. </p></div>
