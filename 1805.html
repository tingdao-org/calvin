<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不肯容他们去。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart. </em>A probable conjecture may be elicited front hence, that at the coming of Moses some light shone forth, so that the darkness was not so thick; because Pharaoh would never have dared to boast himself so proudly without being confident of impunity; but his pretences at the commencement (of their interview) are here omitted by Moses, though the mitigation of the horrible punishment which had urged him to supplication depended upon them. But although he is still in a state of alarm, still he is hardened, and prepares himself for every extremity rather than simply to obey God. Here, also, according to his custom, Moses asserts that God was the author of his obduracy; not because he inspired with obstinacy a heart otherwise disposed to docility and obedience, but because He gave over as a slave to Satan a reprobate who was willfully devoted to his own destruction, that he might rush forward with still increasing pertinacity in his impiety. But, since Moses has so often used this word, I am astonished at the boldness of certain sophists who, by the substitution of the word <em>permission, </em>allow themselves by this frivolous evasion to escape so plain a statement. </p></div>
