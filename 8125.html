<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">扫罗的儿子约拿单有一个儿子名叫米非波设，是瘸腿的。扫罗和约拿单死亡的消息从耶斯列传到的时候，他才五岁。他乳母抱着他逃跑。因为跑得太急，孩子掉在地上，腿就瘸了。</div></div>
