<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>They were let go in peace. </em>That is, when they departed, the brethren, in taking their leave of them, did wish them well, as friends use to do. And there is <em>synecdoche </em>in this member; because the one of the two did only return to Jerusalem. And in the text there is a correction added immediately, that it seemed good to Silas to tarry there; but when Luke joineth them both together, his meaning is only to declare that the Church was quiet before they thought upon any returning. At length he addeth that Paul and Barnabas, so long as they were at Antioch, gave themselves to teaching, and did continue in this work,<span class="cite-ref">(158)</span> and yet did they give place to many more.<span class="cite-ref">(159)</span> Whereby it appeareth, that they had all one and the same desire without grudging,<span class="cite-ref">(160)</span> so that they joined hand in hand to do good; though it seemeth that he maketh mention of many more of set purpose, lest we should think that, after that Paul and Barnabas were departed, that Church was destitute, which did flourish in abundance of teachers. Moreover, the blessing of God, which began straightway to appear again in that Church, is now again commended and extolled, which Church Satan went about<span class="cite-ref">(161)</span> by his ministers miserably to scatter and lay waste. </p><p><strong>(158)</strong></p><p>“Intentos fuisse ad docendum, et in hoc opere assiduos ,” were intent on teaching, and assiduous in the work. </p><p><strong>(159)</strong></p><p>“ Aliis compluribus,” to several other persons. </p><p><strong>(160)</strong></p><p>“ Sine aemulatione,” without rivalship. </p><p><strong>(161)</strong></p><p>“ Nuper molitus erat,” had lately plotted. </p></div>
