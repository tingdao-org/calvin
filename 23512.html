<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_12:22</span><strong>.</strong><em>Then was brought to him. </em>Luke explains from the effect, that the devil by which the man was possessed was <em>dumb; </em>but Matthew says, that a twofold plague had been inflicted on the man. Many persons, no doubt, are blind and deaf on account of natural defects; but it is evident, that this man had become blind, and had been deprived of the use of speech, though there was no defect in his optical nerves, <span class="cite-ref">(104)</span> or in the proportion of his tongue. We need not wonder that so much liberty should be allowed to Satan in injuring the bodily senses, when God justly permits him to corrupt or pervert all the faculties of the soul. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(104)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Aux nerfs appelez Optiques, qui sont les conduits de la veue</span>;”— “in what are called the Optical nerves, which are the conductors of vision.” </p></div></div>
