<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但我要歌颂你的力量，早晨要高唱你的慈爱。因为你作过我的高台。在我急难的日子，作过我的避难所。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>But I will sing of thy power </em>By this he does not mean merely that he would have occasion to sing at some future period, but prepares himself presently for the exercise of thanksgiving; and he proceeds to acknowledge that his deliverance would be at once an illustrious effect of Divine power, and conferred of mere grace. It may be true, that David escaped at this time from the hands of his enemies without stir, and with secrecy, through the dexterity of his wife; still, by means of this artifice, God disappointed the preparations and forces of Saul, and may, therefore, with propriety be said to have exerted his power. We may suppose, however, that David takes occasion, from this particular instance, to look further back, and embrace, in his view, the various Divine interpositions which he had experienced. </p></div>
