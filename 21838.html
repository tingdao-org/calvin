<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那时王在巴比伦省，高升了沙得拉，米煞，亚伯尼歌。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This seems to be of slight consequence; but yet it was not added in vain. We are to understand that the miracle was confirmed throughout the whole province and region, because all the Chaldeans knew those three men were cast into the furnace, and then afterwards shared in the imperial sway and were restored to their former honors. In consequence of this event, God’s power could not be unknown. It was just as it God had sent forth three heralds through the whole region, who <em>everywhere </em>proclaimed how they were wonderfully delivered from death by God’s special interposition. Whence, also, it would be understood how worthless were all the deities then worshipped in Chaldea, and how that great deity whose statue Nebuchadnezzar had set up had been despised, and how the true God proved his consistency in snatching his servants from death. </p></div>
