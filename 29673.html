<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">使一切不信真理，倒喜爱不义的人，都被定罪。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>That all may be condemned</em>. That is, that they may receive the punishment due to their impiety. Thus, those that perish have no just ground to expostulate with God, inasmuch as they have obtained what they sought. For we must keep in view what is stated in <span class="bvs">Deu_13:3</span>, that the hearts of men are subjected to trial, when false doctrines come abroad, inasmuch as they have no power except among those who do not love God with a sincere heart. Let those, then, who <em>take pleasure in unrighteousness</em>, reap the fruit of it. When he says <em>all</em>, he means that contempt of God finds no excuse in the great crowd and multitude of those who refuse to obey the gospel, for God is the Judge of the whole world, so that he will inflict punishment upon a hundred thousand, no less than upon one individual. </p><p>The participle <span class="lang el-gr">εὐδοκήσαντες </span> (<em>taking pleasure</em>) means (so to speak) a voluntary inclination to evil, for in this way every excuse is cut off from the ungrateful, when they take so much <em>pleasure in unrighteousness</em>, as to prefer it to the righteousness of God. For by what violence will they say that they have been impelled to alienate themselves by a mad revolt <span class="cite-ref">(683)</span> from God, towards whom they were led by the guidance of nature? It is at least manifest that they willingly and knowingly lent an ear to falsehoods. </p><p><strong>(683)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En se reuoltant malicieusement</span>;” — “By revolting maliciously.” </p></div>
