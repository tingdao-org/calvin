<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">必有一人像避风所，和避暴雨的隐密处，又像河流在干旱之地，像大磐石的影子在疲乏之地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>And that man shall be. </em>How great is the importance of well-regulated government the Prophet shews plainly by these words, when he calls that king <em>a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the rain</em>; for mankind can never be so happy as when every one voluntarily abstains from every kind of violence and injustice, and when they conduct themselves peaceably and without restraint. Since, therefore, most men are urged and driven by their furious passions to acts of injustice, men would be embroiled in incessant quarreling if a remedy were not provided in the laws and courts of justice; but as many rulers, by a tyrannical exercise of power, raise more troubles than they allay, it is not without good reason that the good king is honored by this peculiar commendation. If this was said with truth concerning Hezekiah, much more may it be said concerning Christ, in whom we have our best, or rather, our only refuge in those storms by which we must be tossed about as long as we dwell in this world. Whenever, therefore, we are scorched by oppressive heat, let us learn to retire under his shadow; whenever we are tossed about by tempests, and think that we are overwhelmed by the violence of the waves, let us learn to betake ourselves to him as our safest harbour; he will speedily bring every storm to a calm, and will completely restore what was ruined and decayed. </p></div>
