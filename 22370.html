<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我必折断大马色的门闩，剪除亚文平原的居民，和伯伊甸掌权的。亚兰人必被掳到吉珥。这是耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He then adds,<em>I will break in pieces the bar of Damascus </em>The Prophet confirms what he had already said; for Damascus, being strongly fortified, might have seemed unassailable. By bar, the Prophet, mentioning a part for the whole, meant strongholds and everything which could keep out enemies. Nothing, then, shall prevent enemies from taking possession of the city of Damascus. How so? Because the Lord will break in pieces its bars. </p><p>It is then added, <em>I will cut off, </em>or <em>destroy</em>, <em>the inhabitant from Bikoth Aven, </em>or from the plain of Aven. It is uncertain whether this was the proper name of a place or not, though this is probable; and yet it means a plain, derived from a verb, which signifies to cut into two, or divide, because a plain or a valley divides or separates mountains; hence a valley or plain is called in Hebrew a division. Now, we know that there were most delightful plains in the kingdom of Syria, and even near Damascus. <em>Aven </em>also may have been the name of a place, though it means in Hebrew <em>trouble </em>or laborer. But whatever it may have been, the Prophet no doubt declares here, that all the plains nigh Damascus, and in the kingdom of Syria, would be deprived of their inhabitants. <em>I will </em>then <em>destroy the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and the holder of the scepter from the house of Eden, </em>or from the house of pleasure. This also may have been the name of a place, and from its situation a region, which, by its pleasantness greatly delighted its inhabitants. But the Prophet, I have no doubt, alludes, in these two words, to <em>trouble </em>and <em>pleasure Removed, he says, shall be the people of Syria into Kir. </em>The purport of this is, that the kingdom of Syria would be wasted, so that the people would be taken into Assyria; for the Prophet declares that the Assyrians would be the conquerors, and remove the spoils into their own kingdom, and lead away the people as captives; for the word city, as a part for the whole, is put here for the whole land. It now follows — </p></div>
