<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Thou shaft not see a fierce people. </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">נועז</span><em>(nognaz) </em>is translated by some “strong,” and by others “impudent;” but, undoubtedly, he intends to express the fierceness of the Assyrians, which he afterwards affirms by saying that they would have no intercourse with them, because they spoke a different language. Nothing is more fitted to excite men to compassion than the intercourse of speech, by which men explain their distresses to each other. When this is wanting, there can be no means of gaining their hearts; each party is a barbarian to the other; and nothing more can be obtained from them than if one were dealing with wild and savage beasts. The Prophet, therefore, dwells largely on the wretched condition of the people, in order to shew, on the other hand, how great was the kindness of God in delivering them from so great terror. In like manner, the Holy Spirit magnifies the grace of God, in preserving his people in Egypt, though </p><p>“they did not understand the language of that nation.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_131:5</span>.) </p></div>
