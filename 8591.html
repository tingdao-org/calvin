<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">爱雅的女儿利斯巴用麻布在磐石上搭棚，从动手收割的时候直到天降雨在尸身上的时候，日间不容空中的雀鸟落在尸身上，夜间不让田野的走兽前来糟践。</div></div>
