<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Lev_19:30</span><strong>; 26:2.</strong><em>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths. </em>From these two passages it is manifest that the service of the tabernacle was annexed to the Sabbath, and that the two things were not only connected by an indissoluble tie, but that the rest from labor had reference to the sacrifices; since it would have been a mere mockery to rest without any ulterior object; nay more, after Moses has spoken of the rest, he seems to subjoin the reverencing of the sanctuary, as if it were the generic ordinance; so that the people might understand that all impediments were removed which are wont to withdraw them from the service of God. The expression, “fear the sanctuary,” <span class="cite-ref">(336)</span> is a figurative one; but is equivalent to this, that they should shew by their very reverence of the sanctuary how truly and sincerely they fear God, who had promised that He would be present there, whenever He should be invoked. </p><p><strong>(336)</strong> “<em>Reverence </em>my <em>sanctuary.” </em>—<em>A.V. Ainsworth </em>says, “In Targum Jonathan this law is explained thus, Ye shall go to the house of my sanctuary in fear;” and then quotes from Maimon many Jewish rites observed in the temple. </p></div>
