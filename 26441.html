<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Jesus saw a man blind. </em>In this chapter, the Evangelist describes the restoration of sight to the blind man, at the same time mingling doctrine, to point out the fruit of the miracle. <em>From his birth. </em>This circumstance gives an additional display of the power of Christ; for <em>blindness</em>, which he had brought from his mother’s womb, and which he had endured till he arrived at the age of a man, could not be cured by human remedies. This gave occasion to the disciples to propose a question, Of whose sin was this the punishment? </p></div>
