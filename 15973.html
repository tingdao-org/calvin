<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">敬畏你的人见我，就要欢喜。因我仰望你的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>74.</strong><em>They who fear thee shall see me and be glad. </em>This verse is either connected with the preceding, or it includes other benefits of God, besides the blessing mentioned in that verse. Whether the Psalmist adverts only to one particular species of blessing, or speaks generally, he by these words highly extols the benefits with which God had honored him, that all genuine saints in common might experience joy on that account. He does not mean to say that this joy proceeds solely from the trust which he reposed in God, but that it also proceeds from this, — that, having been preserved by him in a remarkable way, and loaded with many benefits, his hope had received an ample reward. As God invites all his servants in common to trust in him, it follows, that, whenever he exhibits a token of his grace towards any one of them, he testifies to all that he is faithful to his promises, and that they have no reason to be afraid of his disappointing those who trust in him. </p></div>
