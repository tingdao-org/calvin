<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他永不动摇。义人被记念，直到永远。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>Surely he shall not be moved. </em>The Hebrew particle <span class="lang he-il">כי</span>, <em>ki, </em>may here be taken in its natural or causal meaning, and thus be rendered <em>for, </em>especially if in the preceding verse we adopt the marginal reading, <em>It shall be well with the man. </em>For he refers in more explicit terms to that happiness of which he spake, that God sustains the compassionate and humane, so that amid all the vicissitudes of life they remain unmoved; that he makes their innocence appear, and protects them from unjust calumny. It is said <em>they are never moved </em>They are indeed liable to the incidents common to humanity, and even may often appear as if they were about to sink under the weight of their calamities; but their confidence remains unshaken, and by invincible patience they surmount all their adversities. With God as the defender of their righteousness, they yet do not escape from being assailed by the slanders of the ungodly, but it is enough for them that their name is blessed before God, the angels, and the whole assembly of the godly. </p></div>
