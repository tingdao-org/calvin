<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Draw near to my soul, redeem it. </em>David was doubtless fully persuaded by faith that God was near him; but as we are accustomed to measure the presence or absence of God by the effects, David here tacitly complains, judging according to the flesh, that he is far from him. By the expression, <em>Draw near, </em>he means, that in so far as could be gathered from his actual condition, God appeared to have no regard to his welfare. Again, by calling upon God <em>to draw near to his life, </em>which he seemed to have forsaken, he exhibits a striking proof of the strength of his faith. The more cruelly he is molested by the wicked and proud, the more does he trust that God will appear to deliver him. As has been elsewhere observed, it is always to be held as an undoubted truth, that since “God resisteth the proud” (<span class="bvs">Jas_4:6</span>,) he must at length repress the insolence and pride of those who obstinately resist him, although he may seem to connive at them for a time. </p></div>
