<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Which they have heard of thee are nothing. </em>They seem to persuade Paul to dissemble. For the rumor rose not upon nothing, that he did call away the Jews from the ceremonies, and that he did not walk in observing the law. But we must remember that which I said even now, that it was sufficient for Paul and the elders, if they could remove the slander which was unjustly raised, to wit, that he was a revolt [apostate] from the law, and there might a better opportunity be offered shortly, that in purging himself he might call them back by little and little from their error. Neither was it good or profitable that Paul should be counted an observer of the law any long time, as the disciples were then commonly; for by this means a thick<span class="cite-ref">(482)</span> veil should have been put before their eyes to darken the light of Christ.</p><p>Wherefore, let us know that Paul did not dissemble, but sincerely professed that he did not hate the law, but that he did rather think reverently of it. They will him to bestow cost together with them, because they were wont to put their money together that they might offer sacrifice together.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(482)</span></p><p>“ Crassius,” a thicker. </p></div></div>
