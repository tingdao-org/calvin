<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>And for their sales I sanctify myself. </em>By these words he explains more clearly from what source that <em>sanctification </em>flows, which is completed in us by the doctrine of the Gospel. It is, because he consecrated himself to the Father, that his holiness might come to us; for as the blessing on the first-fruits is spread over the whole harvest, so the Spirit of God cleanses us by the holiness of Christ and makes us partakers of it. Nor is this done by imputation only, for in that respect he is said to have been <em>made to us righteousness; </em>but he is likewise said to have been <em>made to us sanctification, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Co_1:30</span>,) because he has, so to speak, presented us to his Father in his own person, that we may be renewed to true holiness by his Spirit. Besides, though this sanctification belongs to the whole life of Christ, yet the highest illustration of it was given in the sacrifice of his death; for then he showed himself to be the true High Priest, by consecrating the temple, the altar, all the vessels, and the people, by the power of his Spirit. </p></div>
