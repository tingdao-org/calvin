<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Take unto thee sweet spices. </em>This oblation might have been noticed with the others, yet, since it merely describes the composition of the incense, which is connected with the altar of incense, and in fact is but an appendage to it, I have seen no reason why I should separate them. Let the curious subtilely discuss, if they please, the ingredients themselves; it is enough for me that they were chosen at God’s will to make a very sweet smell. For I know not whether it is likely, as some suppose, that galbanum <span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> is of a strong and disagreeable savor, and, since they only offer this conjecture in an unknown matter, they deserve little credit. My conviction is that it was sweet, which the words of Moses himself a little further on confirm, where he denounces the penalty of death upon those who should use such perfume for their private gratification; for this prohibition would have been absurd, unless its odor had been very agreeable. Besides, the analogy between the sign and the thing signified would not have held good, unless its sweet savor had testified that God is greatly pleased with the prayers of His people. Moreover, in order that the sacred symbol might be the more reverenced, it was not allowable to transfer this mixture to private use; for since men are rude and earthly-minded, there is nothing they are more prone to than to mix up heavenly things with those of earth. Therefore, to elevate their minds the more, it was necessary that the incense, in which there was a special holiness due to God alone, should be set apart from common use. </p><p><strong>(154)</strong> “Not of strong and evil savor, as <em>R. Salomom, </em>for then it had been unfit to make a perfume of.” — <em>Tostatus in </em>Willet. “Dioscor. asserit galbanum esse gravis odoris, et Plinius ait galbanum foetere et castorem olere; quod forte intelligit de partibus galbani magis terrestribus — ideoque noster interpres addit<span class="lang el-gr">τὸ</span><em>bonis odoris </em><em>;” </em>(<em>i.e., V., </em>after LXX. <span class="lang el-gr">Χαλβάνην ἡδυσμῦ·</span>) Corn. a Lapide, <em>in loco. </em></p></div>
