<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我的仇敌用恶言议论我，说，他几时死，他的名才灭亡呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>My enemies have spoken evil of me. To speak </em>is here used in the sense of <em>to imprecate. </em>In thus describing the unbecoming conduct of his enemies, he seeks, as has been elsewhere said, to induce God to have mercy upon him: because the more that God sees his own people cruelly treated, he is so much the more disposed mercifully to succor them. Thus David, by his own example, stirs up and encourages us to greater confidence in God; because the more that our enemies break forth in their cruelty towards us, so much the more does it procure for us favor in the sight of God. The terms in which his enemies uttered this imprecation show how cruel their hatred had been towards him, since it could only be appeased by his destruction, and that, too, accompanied with shame and ignominy; for they wished that with his life the very remembrance of his name should also be blotted out. </p></div>
