<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，我仰望你。主我的神阿，你必应允我。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>For on thee, O Jehovah! do I wait. </em>David here shows the source of his patience. It consisted in this, that, trusting in the grace of God, he overcame all the temptations of the world. And certainly, the mind of man will never be framed to gentleness and meekness, nor will he be able to subdue his passions, until he has learned never to give up hope. The Psalmist, at the same time, adds, that he cherished his hope by constant meditation, lest he should yield to despair. And this is the only means of our perseverance, when, on the ground of his own promises, with which we are furnished, we appeal to him, yea, rather when setting before our view his fidelity and his constancy in fulfilling what he has promised, we are sureties to ourselves for him. Accordingly, Paul, in <span class="bvs">Rom_5:4</span>, very properly joins patience to hope and consolation. The repetition of terms in this verse shows, that this holy man was subjected to a severe and arduous conflict. <em>Thou, </em>he says, <em>O Lord! my God, wilt answer me. </em>His language implies, that if God should delay to come to his help, there was reason to fear that he would faint from weariness, or fall into despair, unless, setting this double defense before him, he persevered valiantly in the conflict. </p></div>
