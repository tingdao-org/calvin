<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28</strong><em>. What shall we do, that we may work the works of God? </em>The multitude understood well enough that Christ had exhorted them to aim at something higher than the conveniences of the present life, and that they ought not to confine their attention to the earth, since God calls them to more valuable blessings. But, in putting this question, they are partly mistaken by not understanding the kind of <em>labor</em>; for they do not consider that God bestows upon us, by the hand of the Son, all that is necessary for spiritual life. First, they ask <em>what they ought to do</em>; and next, when they use the expression, <em>the works of God, </em>they do not understand what they say, and talk without any definite object. <span class="cite-ref">(139)</span> In this manner they manifest their ignorance of the grace of God. And yet they appear here to murmur disdainfully against Christ, as if he were accusing them groundlessly. “Dost thou suppose,” say they, “that we have no solicitude about eternal life? Why, then, dost thou enjoin us to do what is beyond our power?” By <em>the works of God </em>we must understand those which God demands, and of which he approves. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(139)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils n’entendent point ce qu’ils disent, et parlent sans certain but</span>.” </p></div></div>
