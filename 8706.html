<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">于是迦得来见大卫，对他说，你愿意国中有七年的饥荒呢？是在你敌人面前逃跑，被追赶三个月呢？是在你国中有三日的瘟疫呢？现在你要揣摩思想，我好回覆那差我来的。</div></div>
