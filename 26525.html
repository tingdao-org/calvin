<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>It was that Mary who anointed the Lord. </em>It is a similar display of ignorance, to imagine that this <em>Mary</em>, <em>the sister of Lazarus</em>, was that woman of wicked and infamous life, who is mentioned by Luke, (<span class="bvs">Luk_7:37</span>.) This mistake was occasioned by the <em>anointing</em>; as if it were not evident enough that Christ was anointed on various occasions, and even at different places. <em>The woman who was a sinner</em>, of whom Luke gives an account, <em>anointed </em>Christ at Jerusalem, where he dwelt; but Mary afterwards <em>anointed </em>him at Bethany, which was her own village. The past tense employed by the Evangelist, <em>who </em>anointed, must be referred, not to the time of the occurrence which he is now relating, but to the time when he wrote; as if he had said, “It was this Mary who afterwards poured on the head of Christ the <em>ointment</em>, on account of which a murmuring arose among the disciples,” (<span class="bvs">Mat_26:7</span>.) </p></div>
