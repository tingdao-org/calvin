<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为，我的年日如烟云消灭，我的骨头，如火把烧着。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>For my days are consumed like smoke </em>These expressions are hyperbolical, but still they show how deeply the desolation of the Church ought to wound the hearts of the people of God. Let every man, therefore, carefully examine himself on this head. If we do not prefer the Church to all the other objects of our solicitude, we are unworthy of being accounted among her members. Whenever we meet with such forms of expression as these, let us remember that they reproach our slothfulness in not being affected with the afflictions of the Church as we ought. The Psalmist compares his days <em>to smoke, </em>and <em>his bones to the stones of the hearth, </em>which, in the course of time, are consumed by the fire. By <em>bones </em>he means the strength of man. And, were not men devoid of feeling, such a melancholy spectacle of the wrath of God would assuredly have the effect of drying up their bones, and wasting away their whole rigor. </p></div>
