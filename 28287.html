<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们没有一个人为自己活，也没有一个人为自己死。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>For no one of us, etc. </em>He now confirms the former verse by an argument derived from the whole to a part, — that it is no matter of wonder that particular acts of our life should be referred to the Lord’s will, since life itself ought to be wholly spent to his glory; for then only is the life of a Christian rightly formed, when it has for its object the will of God. But if thou oughtest to refer whatever thou doest to his good pleasure, it is then an act of impiety to undertake anything whatever, which thou thinkest will displease him; nay, which thou art not persuaded will please him. </p></div>
