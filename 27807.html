<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>I appeal unto Caesar. </em>After that he hath professed that he doth not refuse to die if he be found guilty, he freely useth such helps as he could find at the hands of men. Wherefore, if we be at any time brought into like straits, we must not be superstitious, but we may crave help of the laws and politic order. Because it is written, that magistrates are made and appointed by God to the praise of the godly ( <span class="bvs">Rom_13:3</span>; and <span class="bvs">1Pe_2:13</span>). Neither was Paul afraid to go to law under an unbelieving judge; for he which appealeth commenceth a new action.</p><p>Therefore, let us know that God, who hath appointed judgment-seats, doth also grant liberty to his to use the same lawfully. Therefore, those mistake Paul who think that he doth flatly condemn the Corinthians, ( <span class="bvs">1Co_6:1</span>) because they require help of the magistrate for defense of their right, seeing he reproveth in that place a manifest fault, to wit, because they could suffer no wrong, and because they were too much set upon suing one another, whereby they caused the gospel to be evil spoken of.</p></div>
