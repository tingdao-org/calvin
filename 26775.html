<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>They are not of the world. </em>That the heavenly Father may be more favourably disposed to assist them, he again says that <em>the whole world </em>hates them, and, at the same time, states that this hatred does not arise from any fault of theirs, but because the world hates God and Christ. </p></div>
