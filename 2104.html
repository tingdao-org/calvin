<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人若打坏了他奴仆或是婢女的一只眼，就要因他的眼放他去得以自由。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And if a man smite the eye</em>. Since, in the sight of God, there is neither slave nor free-man, it is clear that he sins as greatly who smites a slave, as if he had struck a free-man. Still, a distinction is made as regards the civil law and human justice, especially if any one have inflicted a wound on his own slave. For here a tooth for a tooth, or an eye for an eye, is not required, but the superiority, which he has improperly abused, is taken from the master; and in compensation for the injury, liberty, which is almost half their life, is given to the male or female slave. Thus, in consideration that it was his slave, t. he master is treated more leniently, when the severity of the punishment is thus mitigated; whilst, in compensation for his dislocation or fracture, the slave receives what is more advantageous to him, viz., that, being set free, he should not be exposed to another’s cruelty. </p></div>
