<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">只是我告诉你们，凡休妻的，若不是为淫乱的缘故，就是叫她作淫妇了。人若娶这被休的妇人，也是犯奸淫了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>Causeth her to commit adultery. </em>As the <em>bill of divorcement </em>bore, that the woman had been loosed from her former husband, and might enter into a new marriage, the man who, unjustly and unlawfully, abandons the wife whom God had given him, is justly condemned for having prostituted his wife to others. </p></div>
