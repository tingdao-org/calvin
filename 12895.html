<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华问撒但说，你曾用心察看我的仆人约伯没有。地上再没有人像他完全正直，敬畏神，远离恶事。你虽激动我攻击他，无故地毁灭他，他仍然持守他的纯正。</div></div>
