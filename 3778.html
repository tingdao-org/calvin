<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation </em>Another exception is subjoined, viz., that none should be received unless they were free from all defect and blemish; for we have seen elsewhere that those, who were blind and lame, or defective in any part of their body, were excluded from the tabernacle, lest their disfigurement should produce contempt; and also that they might be admonished by this external sign, to preserve themselves more diligently from all spiritual defilement. Therefore, those are said to enter into the sanctuary who are fit to exercise the priesthood; and hence the expression, “for the service,” <span class="cite-ref">(426)</span> is added. </p><p>Inasmuch as the inequality (of their charges) might have been the source of envy, God’s authority is asserted at the end of the chapter, where Moses records that he was only acting ministerially, and that he distributed the offices among them according to God’s command. </p><p><strong>(426)</strong> “For the work.” — <em>A. V. </em>Ver. 35. </p></div>
