<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Preach, saying </em>This is the <em>preaching, </em><span class="cite-ref">(571)</span> I spoke of, by which Christ intended to arouse the minds of the nation to expect an approaching redemption. <em>The kingdom of heaven is at hand </em>For <em>the kingdom of heaven </em>Luke substitutes <em>the kingdom of God; </em>but the meaning is the same. It was to inform the Jews, first, that they owed their restoration to divine agency, and not to the kindness of men; secondly, that under the reign of God their condition would be prosperous; and, thirdly, that the happiness which had been promised to them was not earthly and fading, but heavenly and eternal. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(571)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La predication, ou publication</span>;” — “the preaching, or publication.” </p></div></div>
