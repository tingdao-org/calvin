<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但我们既然在捆我们的律法上死了，现今就脱离了律法，叫我们服事主，要按着心灵的新样，不按着仪文的旧样（心灵或作圣灵）。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>But now we have been loosed from the law</em>, <em>etc. </em>He pursues the argument derived from the opposite effect of things, — “If the restraint of the law availed so little to bridle the flesh, that it became rather the exciter of sin; then, that we may cease from sin, we must necessarily be freed from the law.” Again, “If we are freed from the bondage of the law for this end, that we may serve God; then, perversely do they act who hence take the liberty to indulge in sin; and falsely do they speak who teach, that by this means loose reins are given to lusts.” Observe, then, that we are then freed from the law, when God emancipates us from its rigid exactions and curse, and endues us with his Spirit, through whom we walk in his ways. <span class="cite-ref">(207)</span></p><p><em>Having died to that, etc. </em>This part contains a reason, or rather, indicates the manner in which we are made free; for the law is so far abrogated with regard to us, that we are not pressed down by its intolerable burden, and that its inexorable rigor does not overwhelm us with a curse. <span class="cite-ref">(208)</span> — <em>In newness of spirit; </em>He sets the spirit in opposition to the letter; for before our will is formed according to the will of God by the Holy Spirit, we have in the law nothing but the outward letter, which indeed bridles our external actions, but does not in the least restrain the fury of our lusts. And he ascribes <em>newness </em>to the Spirit, because it succeeds the <em>old </em>man; as the letter is called <em>old</em>, because it perishes through the regeneration of the Spirit. </p><p><strong>(207)</strong> That the moral, and not the ceremonial law, is meant here, is incontestably evident from what the Apostle adds in the following verses. He quotes the moral law in the next verse; he calls this law, in <span class="bvs">Rom_7:10</span>, the commandment<span class="lang el-gr">, την ἐντολὴν, </span> which was unto life, see <span class="bvs">Mat_19:16</span>; and he says, that “by it” sin “slew” him, which could not have been said of the ceremonial law. — <em>Ed. </em></p><p><strong>(208)</strong> Our common version is evidently incorrect as to this clause. The pronoun<span class="lang el-gr">αὐτῷ </span> or <span class="lang el-gr">ἐκεινῷ, </span> is to be supplied. There is an exactly similar ellipsis in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:21</span> [<span class="bvs">Beza </span>] and several others, as well as our version, have followed a reading<span class="lang el-gr">, αποθανοντὀ, </span> which [<span class="bvs">Griesbach </span>] disregards as of no authority; and it is inconsistent with the usual phraseology of the Apostle. See <span class="bvs">Rom_7:4</span>, and <span class="bvs">Gal_2:19</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
