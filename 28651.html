<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>If the whole body were an eye </em>He sets aside a foolish aiming at equality, by showing the impossibility of it. “If all the members,” says he, “desire the honor that belongs to the <em>eye, </em>the consequence will be, that the whole body will perish; for it is impossible that the body should remain safe and sound, if the members have not different functions, and a mutual correspondence between them. Hence equality interferes with the welfare of the body, because it produces a confusion that entails present ruin. What madness, then, would it be, should one member, instead of giving way to another, <span class="cite-ref">(755)</span> conspire for its own ruin and that of the body!” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(755)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De s’accommoder et soumettre a l’un des autres membres</span>;” — To accommodate itself, and submit to one of the other members.” </p></div></div>
