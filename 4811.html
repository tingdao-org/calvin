<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>50.</strong><em>And the Lord spake unto Moses. </em>The end and design of God in willing that these nations should be expelled, I have elsewhere explained, <span class="cite-ref">(226)</span> viz, lest they should adulterate the pure worship of God by their admixtures, should corrupt the people by their bad examples, and thus be pollutions to the Holy Land. But Moses now refers to another point, for, when about to speak of the division of the land, he begins by saying that it must be emptied of its inhabitants, that its free and full enjoyment may remain for the children of Israel. We must remark the connection here, for else this passage would have been a supplement of the First Commandment, to which I have indeed appended the latter part of the verse: but, since God declares connectedly, “Ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein, for I have given you the land to possess it,” it would have been absurd that one clause should be disjoined from the other. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(226)</span> See <em>ante, </em>vol. 2: p. 397, etc. </p></div></div>
