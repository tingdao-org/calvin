<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">凡向他有这指望的，就洁净自己，像他洁净一样。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>And every man that hath this hope </em>He now draws this inference, that the desire for holiness should not grow cold in us, because our happiness has not as yet appeared, for that hope is sufficient; and we know that what is hoped for is as yet hid. The meaning then is, that though we have not Christ now present before our eyes, yet if we hope in him, it cannot be but that this hope will excite and stimulate us to follow purity, for it leads us straight to Christ, whom we know to be a perfect pattern of purity. </p></div>
