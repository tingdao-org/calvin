<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. </em>First, this is no exaggeration, but the simple truth. Secondly, he does not simply mean that Christ is a partaker of our nature, but expresses something higher (<span class="lang el-gr">καὶ ἐμφατικώτερον</span>) <em>and more emphatic. </em></p></div>
