<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亲爱的弟兄阿，我们应当彼此相爱。因为爱是从神来的。凡有爱心的，都是由神而生，并且认识神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>Beloved </em>He returns to that exhortation which he enforces almost throughout the Epistle. We have, indeed, said, that it is filled with the doctrine of faith and exhortation to love. On these two points he so dwells, that he continually passes from the one to the other. </p><p>When he commands <em>mutual </em>love, he does not mean that we discharge this duty when we love our friends, because they love us; but as he addresses in common the faithful, he could not have spoken otherwise than that they were to exercise mutual love. He confirms this sentence by a reason often adduced before, even because no one can prove himself to be the son of God, except he loves his neighbors, and because the true knowledge of God necessarily produces love in us. </p></div>
