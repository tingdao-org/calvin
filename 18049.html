<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>The burden upon Arabia. </em>He now passes on to the Arabians, and foretells that they too, in their own turn, will be dragged to the judgment-seat of God; so that he does not leave unnoticed any of the nations which were known to the Jews. He declares that they will be seized with such fear that they will leave their houses and flee into the woods; and he states the direction in which they will flee, that is, to “Dedanim.” </p></div>
