<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在你中间父亲要吃儿子，儿子要吃父亲。我必向你施行审判，我必将你所剩下的分散四方（方原文作风）。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He says, then, <em>fathers shall eat their sons in the midst of you, </em>and this was certainly fulfilled: for Jeremiah speaks of women, but he comprehends men also. (<span class="bvs">Lam_4:10</span>.) For he says that women are tender-hearted, he does not say mothers merely, but that they were humane beyond others; but we know that maternal affection is more tender. But when mothers and those tender ones devour their children, that was the final portent. Now he adds, <em>I will execute, therefore, </em>(for the copula here ought to be resolved into the expletive particle,) <em>judgments against thee </em>That is, in this manner I will really show myself a judge, <em>and I will scatter all thy remnants unto all winds. H </em>e signifies that there should be such dispersion, that no body or name of the people should remain. But that hope might cherish and sustain the Jews, if any name and body of the people had been left. But when God pronounces that they should be offscourings to be scattered to every wind, he takes away all hope of restoration for the present at least. We know that there was a certain number left, but such destruction was necessarily threatened before God gave any hope of his mercy. When he says, <em>to any wind, </em>he signifies in any quarter whatever. For as one or another wind blows so the dust is carried, and the offscourings are dispersed in all directions. It follows — </p></div>
