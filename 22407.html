<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以主耶和华如此说，敌人必来围攻这地，使你的势力衰微，抢掠你的家宅。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here announces the punishment God would inflict on the Israelites. <em>An enemy, </em>he says, <em>and indeed one around you, etc. </em>Some think <span class="lang he-il">צר</span>, <em>tsar, </em>to be a verb in the imperative mood; but this cannot be maintained. But Amos, here declares that an enemy was near the Israelites, who would besiege them on every side. The ungodly are ever wont to seek escapes, and if they see the smallest hole, they think that they can escape. Strange is the presumption of men with regard to God: when they see themselves hemmed in, they are really frightened, yea, they become wholly disheartened; but yet they seek subterfuges on the right hand and on the left, and never submit to God except when constrained. This is the reason why the Prophet now says, that <em>an enemy </em>was near, <em>and indeed around </em>them; as though he said, “You have no reason to think that there is any way of escape open to you; for God has hemmed you in on every side; there is therefore a siege which so confines you, that you in vain hope to escape.” <em>An enemy, </em>he says, is indeed around — <em>around the whole land, who will take away from thee thy strength. </em>Here the Prophet removes from the Israelites their vain confidence; for they could not think of God’s vengeance, while looking on their own power. They indeed thought that they had sufficient protection in their own large number, riches, and arms, as men are wont to set up against God what proceeds from himself, as though creatures could do anything against him, and as though God could not take away, when he pleases, what he has given: and yet such is the blindness of men. Hence the Prophet says, that all the wealth and all the strength in which the Israelites excelled would be useless, inasmuch as an <em>enemy, </em>he says, armed by God, <em>shall take from thee thy strength; and thy palaces shall be plundered. </em></p></div>
