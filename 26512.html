<div class="CUV verse">犹太人又拿起石头来要打他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Then the Jews again took up stones. </em>As true religion, in maintaining the glory of God, burns with its own zeal which the Spirit of God directs, so unbelief is the mother of rage, and the devil hurries on the wicked in such a manner, that they breathe nothing but slaughter. This result shows with what intention they put the question to Christ; for the open confession, of which they pretended to be desirous, instantly drives them to madness. And yet, though they are hurried along, with such violence, to oppress Christ, there can be no doubt that they assigned some plausible reason for their judgment, as if they were acting according to the injunction of the Law, by which God commands that false prophets shall be stoned, (<span class="bvs">Deu_13:5</span>.) </p></div>
