<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但非斯都要讨犹太人的喜欢，就问保罗说，你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里听我审断这事吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And Festus. </em>Whether Festus knew somewhat of their laying await, (which we may well conjecture) or whether he were altogether ignorant thereof, he dealeth unjustly with Paul; and we see how soon those are drawn unto all corruption which are not guided by the Spirit of God. For Festus doth not openly contemn or hate Paul; but ambition, and peradventure also desire of gain, got the upper hand, so that, for pleasing the other part, he doth unjustly bring him in danger of death; also, it is likely that he was enticed with the smell [hope] of some reward to hearken so courteously to the priests. Notwithstanding, I marvel that he giveth Paul leave to choose, and doth not rather, according to this authority, command them to carry him whether he would or no. Surely we gather that he was kept back with fear, lest he should infringe the privilege of the city of Rome,<span class="cite-ref">(599)</span> which was a very odious crime. Notwithstanding, he studied craftily to persuade Paul not to refuse to be judged at Jerusalem. For he was not ignorant of that which indeed came to pass, that a citizen of Rome might lawfully appeal, so that he could then go no farther. Nevertheless, it was no thank to him that he was not delivered into the hands of murderers.<span class="cite-ref">(600)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(599)</span></p><p>“ Jus Romanae civitatis,” the privilege of a Roman citizen. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(600)</span></p><p>“Quo minus sceleratis latronibus mactandum objiceret ,” that he did not expose himself to be murdered by nefarious assassins. </p></div></div>
