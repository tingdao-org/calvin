<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>When ye come into the land. </em>He now adds that this rite must be annually observed, in order that the memory of this extraordinary grace might never perish. But since a commandment is given respecting the continual observation <span class="cite-ref">(142)</span> of the Sabbath, I postpone its explanation to a more appropriate place; except I would cursorily remark, that the proclamation of the blessing is annexed to the sign; because otherwise it would be an empty and unmeaning proceeding. God, therefore, would have the fathers proclaim it unto their children, so that the knowledge of their redemption, being handed down by tradition, may flourish in all ages. The word <span class="lang he-il">עבד</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(143)</span><em>gnebod, </em>some have improperly rendered “work,” whereas it is rather used for “worship;” as in many passages to serve God means the same as to worship Him. We too, in French, call whatever relates to the exercises of piety “God’s service.” Finally, Moses adds that the people professed their faith and obedience by solemn adoration. This indeed they had already done from the beginning, but with little constancy, because they had been so harassed by their afflictions as to neglect their duty; but now they correct the fault of ingratitude. Therefore, they not only declare their feelings of seriousness by bowing the head, but give actual proof of them; for it is expressly said, that they diligently performed whatever was commanded. </p><p><strong>(142)</strong> The word “Sabbath,” which is not translated in the French, is probably an accidental interpolation. </p><p><strong>(143)</strong><span class="lang he-il">עבדה</span>. Est servitus et ministerium. Hic vero accipitur pro ritu. <em>S M </em>— <em>W </em></p></div>
