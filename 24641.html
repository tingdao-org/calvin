<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_10:52</span><strong>.</strong><em>Thy faith hath saved thee </em>By the word<em>faith </em>is meant not only a confident hope of recovering sight, but a loftier conviction, which was, that this <em>blind man </em>had acknowledged Jesus to be the Messiah whom God had promised. Nor must we imagine that it was only some confused knowledge; for we have already seen that this confession was taken from the Law and the Prophets. For the <em>blind man </em>did not at random bestow on Christ the name of <em>Son of David</em>, but embraced him as that person whose coming he had been taught by the divine predictions to expect. Now Christ attributes it to faith that <em>the blind man received sight; </em>for, though the power and grace of God sometimes extend even to unbelievers, yet no man enjoys His benefits in a right and profitable manner, unless he receive them by faith; nay, the use of the gifts of God is so far from being advantageous to unbelievers, that it is even hurtful. And therefore, when Christ says, <em>thy faith hath saved thee, </em>the word <em>saved </em>is not limited to an outward <em>cure</em>, but includes also the <em>health </em>and <em>safety </em>of the soul; as if Christ had said, that by <em>faith </em>the blind man obtained that God was gracious to him, and granted his wish. And if it was in regard <em>to faith </em>that God bestowed his favor on the blind man, it follows that he was justified by <em>faith </em></p></div>
