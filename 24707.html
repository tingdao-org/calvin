<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并且尽心，尽智，尽力爱他，又爱人如己，就比一切燔祭，和各样祭祀，好得多。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>Is better than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices. </em>But it appears to be incongruous that <em>sacrifices, </em>which are a part of divine worship, and belong to the first table of the Law, should be reckoned of less importance than charity towards men. The reply is, Though the worship of God is greatly preferable, and is more valuable than all the duties of a holy life, yet its outward exercises ought not to be estimated so highly as to swallow up brotherly kindness. For we know that brotherly kindness, in itself and simply, is pleasing to God, though <em>sacrifices </em>are not regarded by him with delight or approbation, except with a view to another object. Besides, it is naked and empty <em>sacrifices </em>that are here spoken of; for our Lord contrasts a hypocritical appearance of piety with true and sincere uprightness. The same doctrine is to be found very frequently in the prophets, that hypocrites may know that <em>sacrifices </em>are of no value, unless spiritual truth be joined to them, and that God is not appeased by offerings of beasts, where brotherly kindness is neglected. </p></div>
