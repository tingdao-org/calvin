<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我派祭司示利米雅，文士撒督，和利未人毗大雅作库官管理库房。副官是哈难。哈难是撒刻的儿子。撒刻是玛他尼的儿子。这些人都是忠信的，他们的职分是将所供给的分给他们的弟兄。</div></div>
