<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们要用初熟的麦子磨面，作饼当举祭奉献。你们举上，好像举禾场的举祭一样，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Ye shall offer up a cake. </em>Here another kind of first-fruits is required, to offer up sacred cakes of the first of their dough. First-fruits were offered of their fruits and ears of corn; but the representation was more lively in the bread itself; and, consequently, God would have them present tokens of their gratitude, not only from the barn, but from the mill, and the oven, so that whilst they eat their bread also, they might have Him before their eyes. </p></div>
