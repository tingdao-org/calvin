<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">治民的官府，和长老阿，倘若今日，因为在残疾人身上所行的善事，查问我们他是怎么得了痊愈。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>If we be judged. </em>Undoubtedly Peter layeth tyranny to the charge of the priests and the scribes, because they examine them unjustly concerning a benefit which deserveth praise, as if he and his fellow had committed some heinous offense. If, saith he, we be accused for this cause, because we have made a sick man whole. Peter hath in this place more respect unto the wicked affection of the mind than unto the very order of the question. For if, under color of a miracle, the apostles would have drawn away the people from the true and sincere worship of God, they should have been worthily called to answer for themselves; because religion doth far excel all the good things of this present life. But seeing they (having no cause at all) did wickedly make an offense of that which they ought to have honored, Peter, being supported with this confidence, doth at the first gird them wittily with a taunting preface, because they sit as judges to condemn good deeds. Yet he toucheth this point but lightly, that he may pass over unto the matter. </p></div>
