<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又屡次行远路，遭江河的危险，盗贼的危险，同族的危险，外邦人的危险，城里的危险，旷野的危险，海中的危险，假弟兄的危险。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>By <em>perils from the nation </em>he means those that befell him from his own nation, in consequence of the hatred, that was kindled against him among all the Jews. On the other hand, he had the Gentiles as his adversaries; and in the <em>third </em>place snares were laid for him <em>by false brethren. </em>Thus it happened, that </p><p>for Christ’s name’s sake he was hated by all. <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Mat_10:22</span>.) </p></div>
