<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他必奋勇向前，率领大军攻击南方王。南方王也必以极大极强的军兵与他争战，却站立不住，因为有人设计谋害南方王。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The angel here announces how Antiochus Epiphanes after prevailing by fraud, should become bolder in his daring. he should venture to levy a hostile army and invade Egypt openly, without any further dissimulation. He therefore says, <em>at length he shall rouse his strength and his courage </em>He had previously crept along through hiding-places and fastnesses, and had not roused either his strength or his courage when remaining quiet at home; meanwhile he obtained the possession of various towns by treachery and other artifices. This was only creeping on by burrowing underground. But he now openly declares war, and brings his forces into the field of battle, and thus <em>stirs up his strength and his courage </em>As I have already said, his new method of warfare is here described as unusual with him, as his audacity, doubtless, gradually increased through that series of success which he had enjoyed, and by which he had become more powerful than his nephew, through the practice of deceit. He afterwards adds, <em>with a great army. </em>He had mentioned a small band, he now places opposite to it a large army; for it required a long space of time to collect extensive pecuniary resources for carrying on the war, and also for enlarging and extending his own boundaries. He was thus able to enroll fresh levies, while his prosperity induced many to become his auxiliaries. As he found himself in every way superior to his nephew, he collected a great army. <em>The king of the south also shall be irritated; </em>that is, he shall not dare to harass his own uncle Antiochus, but shall be forced to open warfare. <em>He shall come, then, with a great army, </em>very great, strong, and powerful, says he, <em>but he shall not stand, because they shall devise devices against him; </em>meaning, he shall be conquered by treachery. Here the angel signifies that Ptolemy should have sufficient courage to resist, had he not been betrayed by his adherents. We shall more clearly perceive this in the next verse to-morrow. </p></div>
