<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他差遣使者来见约西亚，说，犹大王阿，我与你何干。我今日来不是要攻击你，乃是要攻击与我争战之家，并且神吩咐我速行，你不要干预神的事，免得他毁灭你，因为神是与我同在。</div></div>
