<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">摩押的居民哪，要离开城邑，住在山崖里，像鸽子在深渊口上搭窝。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here Jeremiah denounces exile on the Moabites; as though he had said, that such would be the desolation of their land, that they would be forced as wanderers to flee here and there. That he bids them to <em>leave their cities, </em>this is not done in the same way as when God commands his people what is right; but he only shews that he was armed with the sword of God, not only to speak with the mouth, but also to perform what he foretells; for the execution ought not to be separated from the prophecies, for the hand of God is joined with his mouth. When, therefore, he announces anything by his servants, the fulfillment also, as it has been stated, is included. </p><p>This is the import of the words, <em>Leave the cities, and dwell among the rocks</em>; that is, Hide yourselves in lurking-places, for no habitable land will afford you rest, or be a convenient place to flee to. <em>And they shall be, </em>he says, <em>like a dove which makes a nest in remote places beyond the clefts of the rocks</em>, or stones. He means the most deserted places. It is the same as though he had said, that it would not be simply an exile that God would allot to the Moabites, but that they would be taken away to regions unknown, and deserted by men. It follows — </p></div>
