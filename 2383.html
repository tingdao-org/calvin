<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们必知道我是耶和华他们的神，是将他们从埃及地领出来的，为要住在他们中间。我是耶和华他们的神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>And they shall know that I am the Lord. </em>In these words God signifies that He has not only been the deliverer of His people on one occasion, but with the object of presiding over their welfare, and of demonstrating practically that He dwells among them. He, moreover, appointed the sanctuary to be the symbol of His presence, and, as it were, its pledge; from whence He would have the rule of piety proceed, and be sought for by His worshippers. </p></div>
