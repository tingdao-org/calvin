<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>O God! be not far from me. </em>It is scarcely possible to express how severe and hard a temptation it was to David, when he knew that the wicked entertained the persuasion that he was rejected of God. They did not without consideration circulate this report; but after having seemed wisely to weigh all circumstances, they gave their judgment on the point as of a thing which was placed beyond all dispute. It was therefore an evidence of heroic fortitude on the part of David, <span class="cite-ref">(110)</span> thus to rise superior to their perverse judgments, and, in the face of them all, to assure himself that God would be gracious to him, and to betake himself familiarly to him. Nor is it to be doubted that, in calling God <em>his God, </em>he makes use of this as a means of defending himself from this hard and grievous assault. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(110)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Parquoy c’a este une vertu a David plus qu’humaine</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “It was therefore fortitude more than human for David.” </p></div></div>
