<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这样，我们便不退后离开你。求你救活我们，我们就要求告你的名。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>In the 18<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse, the faithful engage, upon God’s hearing them, gratefully to acknowledge his goodness, not only by rendering to him the sacrifice of praise, but also by their whole life. <em>Calling upon God’s name, </em>is here to be understood of “the calves of the lips,” (<span class="bvs">Hos_45:3</span>;) but when it is said, <em>We will not go back from thee, </em>this means the uniform and continued course of the whole life. The verse, however, may be interpreted thus: O Lord! we will continue in our obedience to thee, even when our circumstances, so far as we can perceive, are hopeless; never shall the sharpness of our calamities have the effect of driving us to apostasy from thee: and when we are restored by thy grace and power, we will magnify thy name. It would be superfluous to make any farther observations on the last verse, which is repeated for the third time. </p></div>
