<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又看见遍地有硫磺，有盐卤，有火迹，没有耕种，没有出产，连草都不生长，好像耶和华在忿怒中所倾覆的所多玛，蛾摩拉，押玛，洗扁一样。</div></div>
