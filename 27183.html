<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为有许多人被污鬼附着，那些鬼大声呼叫，从他们身上出来。还有许多瘫痪的，瘸腿的，都得了医治。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Unclean spirits. </em>He toucheth certain kinds briefly, that we may know with what miracles they <span class="cite-ref">(501)</span> were brought to attribute any authority to Philip. That crying wherewith the unclean spirits cried was a token of resistance. Wherefore this served not a little to set forth the power of Christ, that he did bind the devils with his commandment, though they resisted stubbornly. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(501)</span> “Samaritae,” the Samaritans. </p></div></div>
