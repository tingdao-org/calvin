<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你的宫殿和你众臣仆的房屋，并一切埃及人的房屋，都要被蝗虫占满了，自从你祖宗和你祖宗的祖宗在世以来，直到今日，没有见过这样的灾。摩西就转身离开法老出去。</div></div>
