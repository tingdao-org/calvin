<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">看哪，时候将到，且是已经到了，你们要分散，各归自己的地方去，留下我独自一人。其实我不是独自一人，因为有父与我同在。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>Yet I am not alone. </em>This correction is added, in order to inform us that, when Christ is forsaken by men, he loses nothing of his dignity. For since his truth and his glory are founded on himself, and. do not depend on what the world believes, if it happen that he is forsaken by the whole world, still he is in no degree impaired, because he is God, and needs not any assistance from another. </p><p><em>Because my Father is with me. </em>When he says that <em>the </em>Father <em>will be with me</em>, the meaning is, that God will be on his side, so that he will have no need to borrow anything from men. Whoever shall meditate on this in a proper manner will remain firm, though the whole world should be shaken, and the revolt of all men will not overturn his faith; for we do not render to God the honor which is due to him, if we are not satisfied with having God alone. </p></div>
