<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb. </em>In this Second Narration, Moses expressly declares that God not only gave them a visible sign, by uplifting the cloud, but that He also verbally commanded the people to leave Mount Sinai, and to set about the performance of the rest of their journey. God says, then, that enough time had been spent in one place; <span class="cite-ref">(1)</span> for, before they left it, an entire year had passed away there. Although there were eleven days’ journey before them before they would arrive at Kadesh-barnea, nevertheless, lest anything should delay the people, who were naturally but too indolent, tie stimulates them by setting before them the ease with which it might be accomplished, telling them that they had but to lift up their feet and advance, in order to attain the promised rest. </p><p><strong>(1)</strong> “Et non sans cause;” and not without reason. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div>
