<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我必设立照管他们的牧人，牧养他们。他们不再惧怕，不再惊惶，也不缺少一个。这是耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms the promise, for he would give them faithful and true pastors, who would perform their office as it behoved them; for it would not be enough that the sheep should be restored to their folds, except they were fed. We indeed know that a sheep is a silly animal, and therefore has need of a shepherd to rule and guide it. God then intimates by these words, that after he had collected his flock into the fold it would be the object of his constant care; for he would appoint pastors, who would discharge their office in a far different way from wolves and sacrilegious robbers. He then adds a promise as to their security, which we shall consider tomorrow. </p></div>
