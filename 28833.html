From being so stern a judge, to become all at once a defender — is not this indicative of a man, that wavers between conflicting dispositions?” <span class="cite-ref">(324)</span> This idea might detract greatly from Paul’s authority; but he answers, that he has obtained what he asked, and that he was therefore satisfied, so that he must now give way to compassion. For, their carelessness having been corrected, there was nothing to hinder their lifting up the man by their clemency, when now prostrate and downcast. <span class="cite-ref">(325)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(324)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’vn homme inconstant, et qui est mené de contraires affections</span>;” — “Of a man that is unsteady, and is influenced by conflicting dispositions.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(325)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce poure homme le voyans bien confus et abbatu</span>;” — “This poor man, on seeing him much abashed and overcome.” </p></div></div>
