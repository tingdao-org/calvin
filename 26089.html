<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这腓力是伯赛大人，和安得烈、彼得同城。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>Was of Bethsaida. </em>The name of the city appears to have been mentioned on purpose, that the goodness of God to the three Apostles may be more illustriously displayed. We know how severely, on other occasions, Christ threatens and curses that city, (<span class="bvs">Mat_11:21</span>; <span class="bvs">Luk_10:13</span>.) Accordingly, when God brought into favor with him some out of a nation so ungodly and wicked, we ought to view it in the same light as if they had been brought out of the lowest hell. And when Christ, after having drawn them out of that deep gulf, honors them so highly as to make them Apostles, it is a distinguished favor and worthy of being recorded. </p></div>
