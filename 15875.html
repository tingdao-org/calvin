<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我在急难中求告耶和华，他就应允我，把我安置在宽阔之地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>I called upon God in my distress. </em>We have here a particular application of the doctrine we formerly mentioned, to the person of David; with which also is conjoined the rejoicing of the whole Church, for whose public welfare God made provision by upholding him. By his own example he establishes the faithful, showing them that they ought not to faint in the day of adversity. He seems designedly to anticipate an objection, which is apt to arise in the minds of men the moment that the goodness of God is proclaimed, “Why does he permit his servants to be so sore oppressed and afflicted?” David therefore reminds them, notwithstanding, that God’s mercy never fails, for we have in prayer, consolation and an antidote for all our ills. The season, too, in which he says that he made supplication, by means of which he obtained deliverance, was that of distress, which touches us, that the time of sad adversity is most proper for abounding in prayer. </p></div>
