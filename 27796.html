<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">过了两年，波求非斯都接了腓力斯的任，腓力斯要讨犹太人的喜欢，就留保罗在监里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And when two years were expired. </em>Seeing Paul knew that the judge who did gape for gain would be favorable to him so soon as he should offer him money, and seeing he had sufficient time to gather the same; it is likely that he did not only bear with the brethren,<span class="cite-ref">(597)</span> but also detest such bribery, wherewith the holiness of civil order is shamefully polluted. Now, whereas governors use to let loose such prisoners as they know are not guilty when they go from the province, Felix took the contrary way to win favor. The Jews had often complained of his filthy gain, of his extortion, cruelty, and unruly government. Claudius Caesar being wearied with so many complaints, did call him out of Judea; to the end the Jews may not spite him so sore, he leaveth Paul bound; so that he maketh the guiltless servant of God, as it were, an offering for his evil deeds, that he may therewithal appease the priests. </p><p><strong>(597)</strong></p><p>“ Pepercisse fratribus,” spare the brethren. </p></div>
