<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并且造男造女。在他们被造的日子，神赐福给他们，称他们为人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Male and female created he them</em>. This clause commends the sacred bond of marriage, and the inseparable union of the husband and the wife. For when Moses has mentioned only one, he immediately afterwards includes <em>both </em>under <em>one </em>name. And he assigns a common name indiscriminately to both, in order that posterity might learn more sacredly to cherish this connection between each other, when they saw that their first parents were denominated as one person. The trifling inference of Jewish writers, that married persons <em>only </em>are called Adam, (or man,) is refuted by the history of the creation; nor truly did the Spirit, in this place, mean anything else, than that after the appointment of marriage, the husband and the wife were like one man. Moreover, he records the blessing pronounced upon them, that we may observe in it the wonderful kindness of God in continuing to grant it; yet let us know that by the depravity and wickedness of men it was, in some degree, interrupted. </p></div>
