<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">西顿哪，你当惭愧。因为大海说，就是海中的保障说，我没有劬劳，也没有生产，没有养育男子，也没有抚养童女。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Be thou ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea hath spoken. </em>This verse is added for the purpose of heightening the picture. We have explained the reason why he speaks particularly of Sidon. He calls Tyre, by way of eminence, (<span class="lang el-gr">κατ ᾿ ἐξοχὴν</span>,) <em>the sea</em>, as if she reigned alone in the midst of the sea. </p><p><em>I have not travailed. </em>These words are immediately added, and belong (<span class="lang el-gr">μιμητικῶς</span>) to a fictitious address put into the mouth of Tyre, in which the Prophet wittily taunts the inhabitants of Tyre, who boasted of her colonies; for she “brought forth” other illustrious cities. “In ancient times,” says Pliny, “she was famous for the cities which she built, Leptis, Utica, and that rival of the Roman empire, Carthage, which aspired to govern the whole world, besides Cadiz, which was built beyond the limits of the world. Her whole superiority now consists of scarlet and purple.” (Plin. Hist. Nat., lib. v. c. 19.) Thus, Isaiah represents Tyre as bewailing her ancient glory, because she has ceased to be a mother, and because it is of no avail to her that she has brought forth so many children, and founded so many cities; for at an early period Carthage sent regularly every year a present to Tyre, for the purpose of doing homage to her as the mother. In this manner Tyre appeared to hold a higher rank than all other cities, since even Carthage, though a rival of the Roman empire, was in some respect subject to Tyre: but the Lord stripped her of all her ornaments in a moment, so that she bewailed her bereavement, as if she had never brought up any children. </p></div>
