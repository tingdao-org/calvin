For we shall see by and by what happened. Luke reckoneth up the circumstances, which do more plainly set forth the power of God, when he saith that the man did never walk, and that he was a cripple even from his mother’s womb, and that he was suddenly healed by the voice of Paul alone before the eyes of all men, and that his legs, which were dead, were made nimble, so that he leapt up without making any stop.<span class="cite-ref">(15)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(14)</span></p><p>“ Probabile est,” it is probable. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(15)</span></p><p>“ Sine difficultate,” without difficulty. </p></div></div>
