<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又看见了一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，进来按手在他身上，叫他能看见。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>He saw a man, named Ananias. </em>It is uncertain whether Luke do yet repeat the words of Christ, or he add this of his own. Those which take it in the person of Luke are moved with some show of absurdity, because it is an unlikely thing that Christ used these words. Although this may be easily answered thus, to wit, that Christ confirmeth Ananias after this sort, There is no cause why thou shouldst fear but that he will receive thee willingly, forasmuch as he already knoweth thy shape by a vision. I have also told him thy name, and whatsoever thou shalt do with him. Yet may the reader choose whether he will. </p></div>
