<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约沙法和他的百姓就来收取敌人的财物，在尸首中见了许多财物，珍宝，他们剥脱下来的多得不可携带。因为甚多，直收取了三日。</div></div>
