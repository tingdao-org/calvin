<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">不可与你们中间所剩下的这些国民搀杂。他们的神，你们不可提他的名，不可指着他起誓，也不可事奉，叩拜。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>That you come not among these nations, </em>etc He distinctly admonishes them that it will be impossible rightly to discharge their duty if they be not carefully on their guard against all sources of corruption. This it was very necessary to enforce upon them. For they were surrounded on all sides by the snares of Satan, and we know how great their proneness to superstition was, or rather how headlong their eagerness for it. First, then, he warns them that intimate intercourse with the nations may involve them in fellowship in crime; for the term <em>mingling </em>used in this passage is equivalent to what is termed by St. Paul, <em>being yoked. </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_6:14</span>) In short, he first removes the incitements or allurements to idolatry, and then declares his detestation of idolatry itself. It is to be observed, however, that he does not expressly mention either bending of the knee, or sacrifices, or other rites, but designates all perverse modes of worship by the terms <em>naming </em>them and <em>swearing </em>by them. Whence we infer that God is defrauded of his honor when ever any particle, however small, of all the things which he claims for himself is transferred to idols. He accordingly concludes that they are to adhere to God alone; in other words, they are to be bound to him out and out. </p></div>
