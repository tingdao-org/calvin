<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华的使者对玛挪亚说，你虽然款留我，我却不吃你的食物，你若预备燔祭就当献与耶和华。原来玛挪亚不知道他是耶和华的使者。</div></div>
