<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29</strong><em>Receive him with all joy</em>. He employs the word <em>all </em>to mean sincere and abundant. He also recommends him again to the Philippians; so intent is he upon this, that all that approve themselves as good and faithful pastors may be held in the highest estimation: for he does not speak merely of one, but exhorts that all such should be held in estimation; for they are precious pearls from God’s treasuries, and the rarer they are, they are so much the more worthy of esteem. Nor can it be doubted that God often punishes our ingratitude and proud disdain, by depriving us of good pastors, when he sees that the most eminent that are given by him are ordinarily despised. Let every one, then, who is desirous that the Church should be fortified against the stratagems and assaults of wolves, make it his care, after the example of Paul, that the authority of good pastors be established; <span class="cite-ref">(161)</span> as, on the other hand, there is nothing upon which the instruments of the devil are more intent, than on undermining it by every means in their power. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(161)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Soit establie et demeure entiere</span>;” — “Be established, and remain entire.” </p></div></div>
