<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以你要对以色列家说，主耶和华如此说，你们仍照你们列祖所行的玷污自己吗？仍照他们可憎的事行邪淫吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now at length the Prophet openly attacks those by whom he was consulted. After showing that they sprang from impure fathers — which was sufficiently manifest from their never ceasing to provoke God in every age from the very beginning to the end — he turns their own language against them, and asks, <em>whether they were polluted after the superstitions of their fathers? </em>The old interpretation is “truly;” but <span class="lang he-il">ה</span>, <em>he</em>, the mark of interrogation, does not allow of that. I am surprised at the rendering of some expositors, are you not polluted?” as if the word were <span class="lang he-il">הלוא</span>, <em>hel-va</em>, for in my opinion they pervert the Prophet’s sense, for this would make him ask absurdly, <em>what? are you polluted in the way of your fathers? and are you gone astray after their idols? </em>For when they were in exile, that disinheriting ought to subdue them although they had been endued with a more than iron pride: and then they pretended to piety, when they came to the Prophet and desired to receive some consolation from him. Since, therefore, they pretended to some modesty, God here asks them <em>how they could pollute themselves in the way of their fathers? </em>what could it all mean? the things are quite contrary: you approach my servant as if you intended to submit your minds and your senses to my word; but when you so feign yourselves to be attentive to my answers, <em>how does it happen that you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers? </em>This seems to me the Spirit’s meaning. <em>You shall say</em>, then, <em>are you polluted in the way of your fathers? </em>that is, are you so obstinate as not to reflect upon your course, and never to look back? for you see how severely God was revenged on your obstinacy: you now seek me in appearance, as if this were your only refuge; then how is it that <em>you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers? and why do you commit fornication after their idols? </em>It now follows — </p></div>
