<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我却要降火在迦萨的城内，烧灭其中的宫殿。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now follows a denunciation of punishment, — that <em>God would send a fire on the wall of Gaza, to devour its palaces. </em>And it hence appears that Gaza was a splendid town, and sumptuously built; and for this reason the Prophet speaks of its palaces. He shows, at the same time, that neither strength nor wealth would prevent God from executing the punishment which the Gazites deserved. He names also other cities of Palestine, even <em>Ascalon </em>and <em>Azdod, </em>or <em>Azotus, </em>and <em>Ecron. </em>These cities the Philistine then possessed. The Prophet then intimates, that wheresoever they might flee, there would be no safe place for them; for the Lord would expose as a prey to enemies, not only Gaza, but also all the other cities. We may conclude that Ascalon was the first city; for there was the royal residence, though Gaza was the capital of the whole nation; it might yet be that the pleasantness of its situation, and other attractions, might have induced the king to reside there, though it was not the metropolis; <em>Him </em>then <em>who holds the scepter I will cut off from Ascalon. </em>He at last concludes, that all the remnants of Palestine would be destroyed. Now, whenever God denounces destruction on the Jews, he ever gives some hope, and says that the remnant would be saved: but here the Prophet declares that whatever remained of that nation would be destroyed; for God purposed to destroy them altogether, and also their very name. </p></div>
