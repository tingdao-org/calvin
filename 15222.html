<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因这是为以色列定的律例，是雅各神的典章。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>For this is a statute to Israel. </em>To give the more effect to the preceding exhortation, it is here taught that this law or ordinance had been prescribed to God’s ancient people, for the purpose of ratifying the everlasting covenant. And as in covenants there is a mutual agreement between the parties, it is declared that this <em>statute was given to Israel, </em>and that God, in contracting, reserved this for himself, as a right to which he was justly entitled. </p></div>
