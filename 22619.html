<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以人血建立锡安，以罪孽建造耶路撒冷。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Then when he says, that Zion <em>was built by blood, and Jerusalem by iniquity, </em>it is the same as though the Prophet had said, that whatever the great men expended on their palaces had been procured, and, as it were, scraped together from blood and plunder. The judges could not have possibly seized on spoils on every side, without being bloody, that is, without pillaging the poor: for the judges were for the most part corrupted by the rich and the great; and then they destroyed the miserable and the innocent. He then who is corrupted by money will become at the same time a thief; and he will not only extort money, but will also shed blood. There is then no wonder that Micah says, that Zion was <em>built by blood </em>He afterwards extends wider his meaning and mentions <em>iniquity, </em>as he wished to cast off every excuse from hypocrites. The expression is indeed somewhat strong, when he says, that Zion was built by blood. They might have objected and said, that they were not so cruel, though they could not wholly clear themselves from the charge of avarice. “When I speak of blood,” says the Prophet, “there is no reason that we should contend about a name; for all iniquity is blood before God: if then your houses have been built by plunder, your cruelty is sufficiently proved; it is as though miserable and innocent men had been slain by your own hands.” The words, <em>Zion </em>and <em>Jerusalem, </em>enhance their sin; for they polluted the holy city and the mount on which the temple was built by the order and command of God. </p></div>
