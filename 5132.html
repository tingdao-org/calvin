<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并且耶和华你神必打发黄蜂飞到他们中间，直到那剩下而藏躲的人从你面前灭亡。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Moreover, the Lord thy God will send the hornet. </em>Since the destruction of their enemies might seem long, if they were only to be slain by their hands and weapons, and again, because it was scarcely credible that, without defending themselves, they would voluntarily stretch forth their own throats, God promises that in another way also He would supply the means of their conquest. Therefore, lest the Israelites, imagining that their enemies would be prompt and vigorous in resistance, should be alarmed or affrighted, God declares that other forces should be at hand, for that hornets or other poisonous insects should destroy all the fugitives. The same declaration is found in <span class="bvs">Exo_23:0</span>; and what God had promised, Joshua relates that He performed. (<span class="bvs">Jos_24:12</span>.) But inasmuch as these nations were not to be destroyed in a moment, lest the people should therefore grow weary or become inactive, God anticipates this, and reminds them that this delay would be advantageous, for when all the inhabitants were exterminated, the wild beasts would occupy the empty land. The prolongation of the war, therefore, ought not to trouble them, for by it God provided for His people’s welfare, since, if the men were speedily destroyed, they should have to contend with wild beasts. But though the passage which I have quoted from Exodus is similar in terms, yet I have designedly placed it under another head; for God here refers to the extermination of the Gentile nations with another object, <em>i.e., </em>lest any of the ancient pollutions should remain in the land, and lest the Israelites should mingle with the ungodly, by whose arts they might at length be drawn away to spurious religions. </p></div>
