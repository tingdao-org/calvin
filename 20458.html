<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们心中的快乐止息，跳舞变为悲哀。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He pursues the same subject, but he seems more clearly to explain what he had briefly stated in the preceding verse, when he says that <em>all joy of the heart had ceased, and that all the dances were turned into mourning </em><span class="cite-ref">(234)</span> We know that life is more bitter than death when men are in constant mourning; and truly where there is no hilarity, that state of life is worse than death. And this is what the Prophet now means by saying that all joy had ceased, and that all dances were converted into mourning. </p><p><strong>(234)</strong> The words ought rather to be thus rendered, — </p><p>Turned into mourning was our piping. </p><p>The word does not mean dancing, but playing on some fistular instrument. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
