<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大利乌第二年十一月，就是细吧特月二十四日，耶和华的话临到易多的孙子，比利家的儿子先知撒迦利亚，说，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here is related a second prophecy, connected with a vision. At the beginning God alone spoke and gave commission to his Prophet to reprove the Jews: he now confirms the prediction as to the reduction of the city; for to the word is added a vision, which is, as we have seen elsewhere, a sort of seal. As the vision is obscure it may be variously explained, but I shall endeavor to accommodate it, without any refinements, to our use; and so no ambiguity will remain, provided we seek to be soberly and moderately wise, that is, provided we aim at no more than what edification requires. </p></div>
