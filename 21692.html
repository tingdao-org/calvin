<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在河这边与那边的岸上必生长各类的树木。其果可作食物，叶子不枯干，果子不断绝。每月必结新果子，因为这水是从圣所流出来的。树上的果子必作食物，叶子乃为治病。</div></div>
