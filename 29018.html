<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>Who is weak. </em>How many there are that allow all offenses to pass by unheeded — who either despise the infirmities of brethren, or trample them under foot! This, however, arises from their having no concern for the Church. For concern, undoubtedly, produces <span class="lang el-gr">συμπάθειαν </span> (<em>sympathy,</em>) <span class="cite-ref">(867)</span> which leads the Minister of Christ to participate in the feelings of all, <span class="cite-ref">(868)</span> and put himself in the place of all, that he may suit himself to all. </p><p><strong>(867)</strong> See Calvin’s <em>Harmony, </em>vol. 2, p. 232. </p><p><strong>(868)</strong><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Prend en soy les afflictions de tous</span>;” — “Take upon himself the afflictions of all.” </p></div>
