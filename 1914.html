<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">到了晨更的时候，耶和华从云火柱中向埃及的军兵观看，使埃及的军兵混乱了，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>And it came to pass, that, in the morning-watch. </em>In the morning the angel began to look upon the Egyptians, not that they had escaped his sight before; but for the purpose of destroying them by sudden submersion, though he had seemed previously to forget them, when hidden by the cloud. <span class="cite-ref">(157)</span> And first, He opened their eyes, that too late they might see whither their mad impetuosity had brought them; and also that they might perceive how they were contending not with man only, but with God; and that thus, being overwhelmed with sudden astonishment, they might not be able to escape to the shore in time; for they were on this account overtaken in the midst of the sea, because terror had thrown them into utter confusion, when they perceived that God was against them. They saw that there was no greater hope of safety than to retreat, because God fought for Israel; but being in complete disorder, they could make no way, and whilst they rather proved hindrances to each other, the sea ingulfed them all. </p><p><strong>(157)</strong> La nuit. — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
