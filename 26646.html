<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我实实在在地告诉你们，仆人不能大于主人。差人也不能大于差他的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Verily, verily, I tell you. </em>These are indeed proverbial sayings, which admit of a far more extensive application, but which ought to be accommodated to the case in hand. In my opinion, therefore, they are mistaken who suppose them to have a general acceptation, as if Christ were now exhorting his disciples to bear the cross; for it is more correct to say that he employed them to serve his purpose. </p></div>
