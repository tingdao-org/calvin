<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>While he spoke these things. </em>Though the Jews, at that time, almost resembled a dry and barren soil, yet God did not permit the seed of his word to be entirely lost. Thus, contrary to all hopes, and amidst so many obstructions, some fruit appears. But the Evangelist inaccurately gives the name of<em>faith </em>to that which was only a sort of preparation for <em>faith </em>For he affirms nothing higher concerning them than that they were disposed to receive the doctrine of Christ, to which also the preceding warning refers. </p></div>
