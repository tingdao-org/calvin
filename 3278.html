<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">故此，你们要守我的律例典章。这一切可憎恶的事，无论是本地人，是寄居在你们中间的外人，都不可行，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Ye shall therefore keep my statutes </em>He here contrasts His Law with the abominations of the Gentiles. The exhibition of His severity, which He had referred to, might indeed have sufficed for the instruction of His people; but in order to influence them more strongly, He at the same time adduces the way pointed out to them in the Law, which would not suffer them to go astray, if only they refused not to follow God. For that the Gentiles, who were destitute of light, should have been drawn aside in every direction was not surprising; but whilst they thus proved their blindness, it behooved true believers, on the contrary, to testify that they were not children of darkness, but of light. And to this Paul seems to allude, when he exhorts believers not to walk, like the Gentiles, “in the vanity of their mind.” (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:17</span>.) On this account God not only commends to them His precepts and statutes, but also His ordinances (<em>custodias</em>,) because He had omitted nothing in the Law which would be useful for the direction of men’s lives. The sum is, that unless they order themselves constantly by the doctrine which enlightens them, the same destruction awaited them also which was about to overwhelm the (Canaanitish) nations. </p></div>
