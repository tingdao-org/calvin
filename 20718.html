<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我的手必攻击那见虚假异象，用谎诈占卜的先知，他们必不列在我百姓的会中，不录在以色列家的册上，也不进入以色列地。你们就知道我是主耶和华。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Besides, he afterwards points out the punishment; <em>my hand</em>, says he, <em>shall be against the prophets</em>. For although God threatens to become an adversary to the reprobate, yet this is not sufficient to terrify them, they are so stupid. But it is necessary to use another stimulus, namely, that God should display his power. This is the reason why he now adds, <em>his hand should be against the false prophets</em>. The hand is sometimes taken for a blow: but because God sees the impious torpid amidst their sins, he says that he would not only be their enemy and an avenger of his glory, but he brings forward his own hand into the midst. It follows, <em>they shall not be in the counsel of my people</em>. Some explain the noun <span class="lang he-il">סוד</span>, <em>sod</em>, more subtlety than they need for that experience of God which is offered to the elect for their salvation. But this explanation is forced, for they are deceived in thinking that the Prophet’s meaning is different in the second clause, where he adds, they shall not be written in the list of the house of Israel: he repeats the same thing in different words: in the first place he had said, they should not be in the secret of the people: for <span class="lang he-il">סוד</span>, <em>sod</em>, signifies a secret, but it is taken for counsel: <em>they shall not be therefore in the assembly of the people</em>: afterwards he adds, <em>they shall not be in the catalogue of the house of Israel</em>. He mentions a catalogue, because judges and others elected to any office were written in a list. We see, therefore, what the Prophet intends — for I am compelled to break off here — namely, that those impostors who wished to enjoy the prophetic title, were altogether without the Church, since God had cast them off. </p></div>
