<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>I will celebrate the name of God in a song. </em>The Psalmist now elevated with joy, and sustained by the confident hope of deliverance, sings the triumphant strains of victory. This psalm, there is every reason to believe, was composed after he had been delivered from all apprehension of dangers; but there can be no doubt that the very topics with which it concludes were the matter of his meditation, when trembling with anxiety in the midst of his troubles; for he laid hold upon the grace of God by assured faith, although that grace was then hidden from him, and only the matter of his hope. God is here said <em>to be magnified by our praises; </em>not because any addition can be made to his dignity and glory, which are infinite, but because by our praises his name is exalted among men. </p></div>
