<div class="CUV verse">主的道大大兴旺而且得胜，就是这样。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Grew mightily </em>[ <em>lions. </em>] The word <span class="lang el-gr">κατα κρατος</span> doth signify that the word increased not a little, (or that these proceedings were not common) as if he should say, that in those increasings appeared rare efficacy, and such as was greater than it used commonly to be. The word <em>grew </em>do I refer unto the number of men, as if he should have said, that the Church was increased, new disciples being gathered together dally, because doctrine is spread abroad. And I interpret that, that the word was confirmed in every one thus, to wit, that they did profit in the obedience of the gospel and in godliness more and more, and that their faith took deeper root.</p></div>
