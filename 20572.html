<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们分散在各国的时候，我必在列邦中使你们有剩下脱离刀剑的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Yet here another promise is added, which may temper the bitterness of so sorrowful a prophecy. For hitherto God shows that he burns with indignation against the land of Israel, so that he determined to destroy it, since it was polluted everywhere, and at all corners. Nothing could therefore be hoped for, if Ezekiel had spoken precisely; therefore a promise is added in mitigation — <em>I will leave a remnant, says he, that you may have some who escape the sword; </em>that is, that some of you may survive. But how? God does not promise simple pardon, that he may leave the Israelites quiet and safe in the land, but he says that their safety shall be in exile. Hence therefore we collect that they were so depraved that they were unable to obtain pardon, because God says that his <em>patience </em>was their scorn and aversion. Although, therefore, he gives the Israelites some hope of favor, yet he also admonishes them that they could not obtain safety in any other way, except by a kind of death, namely exile. <em>I will leave a remnant, </em>says he, <em>of you, who shall escape the sword; </em>but how? whom shall the enemy have spared so that they do not change their place? nay, he says, <em>when ye shall be dispersed among the Gentiles </em>He promises them life, therefore, but a wretched one, because it was united with exile. But God’s favor cannot be sufficiently estimated from these words, unless what follows immediately is added. </p></div>
