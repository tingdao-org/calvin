<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那妇人就留下水罐子，往城里去，对众人说，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Therefore the woman left her pitcher. </em>This circumstance is related by the Evangelist to express the ardor of her zeal; for it is an indication of haste, that she leaves her pitcher, and returns to the city. And this is the nature of faith, that when we have become partakers of eternal life, we wish to bring others to share with us; nor is it possible that the knowledge of God shall lie buried and inactive in our hearts without being manifested before men, for that saying must be true: </p><p>I believed, and therefore I will speak, (<span class="bvs">Psa_116:10</span>.) </p><p>The earnestness and promptitude of the woman are so much the more worthy of attention, that it was only a small spark of faith that kindled them; for scarcely had she tasted Christ when she spreads his game throughout the whole city. In those who have already made moderate progress in his school, sluggishness will be highly disgraceful. But she may appear to deserve blame on this account, that while she is still ignorant and imperfectly taught, she goes beyond the limits of her faith. I reply, she would have acted inconsiderately, if she had assumed the office of a teacher, but when she desires nothing more than to excite her fellow-citizens to hear Christ speaking, we will not say that she forgot herself, or proceeded farther than she had a right to do. She merely does the office of a trumpet or a bell to invite others to come to Christ. </p></div>
