<div class="CUV verse">门徒就照耶稣所吩咐的去行，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And the disciples went </em>It was just now remarked, that the zeal and readiness of <em>the disciples </em>to obey are here mentioned with commendation; for the influence of Christ was not so great, that his name alone would be sufficient to produce an impression on unknown persons; and besides, there was reason to fear that they would be blamed for theft. It is therefore a proof of the deference which they paid to their Master, when they make no reply, but proceed readily towards that place to which he has ordered them to go, relying on his command and promise. Let us also learn by their example to press forward through every kind of difficulty, so as to render to the Lord the obedience which he demands from us; for he will remove obstacles, and open up a path, and will not permit our endeavors to be unavailing. </p></div>
