<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">生出坚固的枝干，可作掌权者的杖。这枝干高举在茂密的枝中，而且它生长高大，枝子繁多，远远可见。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He adds, <em>she had branches</em>, that is, vine twigs, <em>for the scepters of those who bear rule</em>. Those who translate with or above the scepters of rulers do not seem to me to comprehend the Prophet’s meaning. I have no doubt he intends that scepters were gathered from these vine branches, or rather that they were so formed as to be like royal scepters. Although this translation seems rather rough, yet the sense is not doubtful; because the Prophet means that kings were taken from the people just as branches from the vine, as God chose king’s from David to Zedekiah. In this sense he says <em>that the vine branches became scepters of the rulers. </em>He afterwards adds<em>, her stature was conspicuous, that she was remarkable for her loftiness even in the multitude of the vine branches. </em>This is extended to the whole body of the people. Since mention is made of the king, there is no doubt that God commends his grace towards the whole people, whose safety and happiness were placed in the king, as we saw elsewhere. But he asserts more clearly that the people had increased, so that they excelled in population, power, and wealth. On the whole, the Prophet teaches that the Jews were adorned from the beginning with all kinds of advantages, since God’s best gifts shone forth there, and their dignity was conspicuous, and their opulence great, since he unites the <em>multitude of the boughs </em>or vine branches with their height. </p></div>
