This is in the shape of a concession, as if he had said, “I do not wish you to be bound to give me credit on any other condition than that you see the fact plainly before your eyes. <span class="cite-ref">(303)</span> You may safely reject me, if God has not openly given testimony to me.” </p><p><em>The works of my Father. </em>He gives them this name, because those works were truly Divine, and because so great power shone in them, that they could not be ascribed to a man. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(303)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sinon que vous voyez le faict evident devant vos yeux</span>.” </p></div></div>
