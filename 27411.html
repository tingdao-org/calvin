<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>49.</strong><em>The word of the Lord was spread abroad. </em>Luke doth in this place declare the proceeding <span class="cite-ref">(839)</span> of the gospel; wherein appeareth how true the parable of Christ is, when he saith that it is like to leaven, (<span class="bvs">Luk_13:21</span>.) We heard before that there was great concourse of people, so that the seed of true doctrine was sown throughout the whole city. Luke saith now that it was spread farther, to wit, throughout the whole country. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(839)</span> “Progressum,” the progress. </p></div></div>
