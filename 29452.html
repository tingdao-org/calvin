<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>But I rejoiced </em>He now declares the gratitude of his mind towards the Philippians, that they may not regret their beneficence, <span class="cite-ref">(246)</span> as is usually the case when we think that our services are despised, or are reckoned of no account. They had sent him by Epaphroditus supplies for the relief of his necessity; he declares that their present had been acceptable to him, and he says, that he rejoiced that they had plucked up new vigor so as to exercise care respecting him. The metaphor is borrowed from trees, the strength of which is drawn inward, and lies concealed during winter, and begins to flourish <span class="cite-ref">(247)</span> in spring. But immediately afterwards subjoining a correction, he qualifies what he had said, that he may not seem to reprove their negligence in the past. He says, therefore, that they had formerly, too, been concerned respecting him, but that the circumstances of the times had not admitted of his being sooner relieved by their benignity. Thus he throws the blame upon the want of opportunity. I take the phrase <span class="lang el-gr">ἐφ᾿ ᾧ᾿</span> as referring to the person of Paul, and that is its proper signification, as well as more in accordance with the connection of Paul’s words. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(246)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin qu’ils ne se repentent point de luy auoir assiste</span>;” — “That they may not regret their having assisted him.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(247)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A reprendre vigueur et fleurir</span>;” — “To recover strength and flourish.” </p></div></div>
