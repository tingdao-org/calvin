<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以我们说，日后你们对我们，或对我们的后人这样说，我们就可以回答说，你们看我们列祖所筑的坛是耶和华坛的样式。这并不是为献燔祭，也不是为献别的祭，乃是为作你我中间的证据。</div></div>
