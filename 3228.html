<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那放羊归与阿撒泻勒的人要洗衣服，用水洗身，然后进营。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And he that let the goat go. </em>Since this goat was the outcast (<span class="lang el-gr">κάθαπμα</span>) of God’s wrath, and devoted to His curse, he who led it away is commanded to wash his person and his clothes, as if he were a partaker in its defilement. By this symbol the faithful were reminded how very detestable is their iniquity, so that they might, be affected with increasing dread, whenever they considered what they deserved. For when they saw a man forbidden to enter the camp because he was polluted by simply touching the goat, they must needs reflect how much wider was the alienation between God and themselves, when they bore upon them an uncleanness not contracted elsewhere, but procured by their own sin. The same may be said of him who burned the skin, the flesh, and the dung of the bullock and the goat. We have elsewhere seen that these remnants were carried out of the camp in token of abomination. And on this head Christ’s inestimable love towards us shines more brightly, who did not disdain to go out of the city that He might be made an outcast (<em>rejectamentum</em>) for us, and might undergo the curse due to us. </p></div>
