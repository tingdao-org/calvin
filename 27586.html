<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚波罗在哥林多的时候，保罗经过了上边一带地方，就来到以弗所。在那里遇见几个门徒。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong>Luke showeth here that the Church of Ephesus was not only confirmed and increased by Paul’s return, but also that there was a miracle wrought there, because the visible graces of the Spirit were given to certain rude and new disciples. Furthermore, it is not known whether they were inhabitants of the city or strangers; neither doth it greatly skill. It is not to be doubted but that they were Jews, because they had received the baptism of John; also, it is to be thought that they dwelt at Ephesus when Paul found them there.</p></div>
