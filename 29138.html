<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Wherefore thou art no more a servant</em>. In the Christian Church slavery no longer exists, but the condition of the children is free. In what respect the fathers under the law were slaves, we have already inquired; for their freedom was not yet revealed, but was hidden under the coverings and yoke of the law. Our attention is again directed to the distinction between the Old and New Testaments. The ancients were also sons of God, and heirs through Christ, but we hold the same character in a different manner; for we have Christ present with us, and in that manner enjoy his blessings. </p></div>
