<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>But my servant Caleb. </em>By <em>synecdoche </em>Caleb alone is now excepted, although Joshua was a partaker of the same grace, as he had been also a sharer in his courageous conduct; but Caleb is especially distinguished, because he had, as it were, uplifted the banner, and had stood forth first to encourage Joshua, The sum of his praise is that he “fulfilled <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> to go after God.” The word “will,” which some understand, is superfluous, since the expression is complete without any addition. God, therefore, commends Caleb’s perseverance in obeying; because he not only promptly exhorted the others, but also proceeded boldly and unhesitatingly, without being deterred by any obstacles. God, however, magnifies his perseverance, because he looked to Him alone in his noble conflict with so great a multitude. For it is an extraordinary case for a person to stand firm, and to hold a straight course in the midst of violent and tempestuous disturbances, when all the world is, as it were, convulsed. Although the word <span class="lang he-il">רוח</span>, <em>ruach, </em><span class="cite-ref">(62)</span> is sometimes used for the disposition of the mind, yet I have no doubt but that Moses signifies, by <em>metonymy, </em>that Caleb was thus influenced by divine inspiration. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span><em>A.V., </em>“Followed me fully.” <em>“Hebr., </em>he fulfilled after me: so in <span class="bvs">Deu_1:36</span>, and <span class="bvs">Jos_14:8</span>.” — Ainsworth. “<em>Implevit</em>, subaudi, verbum meum, vel voluntatem meam.” — <em>S.M. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(62)</span> “This <em>other spirit </em>was the spirit of faith, which the Law cannot give, (<span class="bvs">Gal_3:2</span>) — the spirit of adoption of sons, not of bondage to fear again, <span class="bvs">Rom_8:14</span>. By the guidance of this spirit, Caleb constantly followed the Lord, and obtained the promised inheritance.” — Ainsworth. </p></div></div>
