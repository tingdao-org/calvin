<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbor's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们就要把这二人带到本城门，用石头打死女子是因为虽在城里却没有喊叫。男子是因为玷污别人的妻。这样，就把那恶从你们中间除掉。</div></div>
