<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们要往旷野去，走三天的路程，照着耶和华我们神所要吩咐我们的祭祀他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>We will go three days’ journey. </em>This is the conclusion that no change must be made in God’s command, but that His injunction must be obeyed simply, and without exception. Nor is there little praise due to the firmness of Moses, who so boldly and unreservedly rejected the pretended moderation of the tyrant, because it would have somewhat interfered with the will of God. He therefore declares that the Israelites would do no otherwise than as God had prescribed. </p></div>
