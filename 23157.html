<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>After the Babylonish exile </em>That is, after the Jews were carried into captivity: for the Evangelist means, that the descendants of David, from being kings, then became exiles and slaves. As that captivity was a sort of destruction, it came to be wonderfully arranged by Divine providence, not only that the Jews again united in one body, but even that some vestiges of dominion remained in the family of David. For those who returned home submitted, of their own accord, to the authority of Zerubbabel. In this manner, the fragments of the royal scepter <span class="cite-ref">(95)</span> lasted till the coming of Christ was at hand, agreeably to the prediction of Jacob, “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come,” (<span class="bvs">Gen_49:10</span>.) And even during that wretched and melancholy dispersion, the nation never ceased to be illuminated by some rays of the grace of God. The Greek word <span class="lang el-gr">μετοικεσία</span>, which the old translator renders <em>transmigration, </em>and Erasmus renders <em>exile, </em>literally signifies <em>a change of habitation. </em>The meaning is, that the Jews were compelled to leave their country, and to dwell as “strangers in a land that was not theirs,” (<span class="bvs">Gen_15:13</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(95)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui avoit este mis bas, et comme rompu</span>;” — “which had been thrown down, and, as it were, broken.” </p></div></div>
