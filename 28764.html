<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>But this is not first, which is spiritual. </em>“It is necessary,” says he, “that before we are restored in Christ, we derive our origin from Adam, and resemble him. Let us, therefore, not wonder, if we begin with the <em>living soul, </em>for as <em>being born </em>precedes in order <em>being born again, </em>so <em>living </em>precedes <em>rising again.” </em></p></div>
