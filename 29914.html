<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>Exhort likewise younger men </em>He merely enjoins that young men be instructed to be <em>temperate; </em>for temperance, as Plato shows, cures the whole understanding of man. It is as if he had said, “Let them be well regulated and obedient to reason.” </p></div>
