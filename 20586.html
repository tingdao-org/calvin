<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我快要将我的忿怒倾在你身上，向你成就我怒中所定的，按你的行为审判你，照你一切可憎的事刑罚你。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He repeats here almost the same words. We have explained the intention, namely, that the Israelites should be positively assured that God threatened not for the sake of frightening them, but because the execution of his wrath was prepared. <em>Now, </em>says he, <em>I will shortly pour out my indignation </em>He had said the day was at hand. This refers to the time; for it would be foolish to place together <em>I will shortly pour out my indignation, against thee, </em>and <em>I will fulfill my indignation against thee; </em>this <em>fulfilling </em>explains what he had formerly said concerning the end. For God had formerly executed his vengeance against the Israelites, but not completely. This completion, then, of God’s wrath prevails even as far as their ultimate destruction. Now I have explained those words — <em>I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will put upon thee all thine abominations </em></p></div>
