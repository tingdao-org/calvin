<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我就必使这殿如示罗，使这城为地上万国所咒诅的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Then will I make, etc</em>. : the copulative is to be rendered here as an adverb of time. What had been just said, “but ye have not hearkened,” was by way of anticipation; for the Jews, swelling with great arrogance, might have immediately said, “Oh! what new thing dost thou bring? <em>Except ye hearken to my voice, saith Jehovah, to walk in my Law, which I have set before you, </em>as though all this were not well known even to children among us; and yet thou pretendest to be the herald of some extraordinary prophecy; certainly such boasting will be deemed puerile by all wise men.” Thus then they might have spoken, but the Prophet here briefly checks the insolence of such a foolish censure, <em>but ye have not hearkened; </em>as though he had said, that he had not been sent in vain to speak of a thing as it were new and unusual, because the Jews had corrupted the whole Law, had become disobedient, unteachable, and unbelieving, and had despised both the Law of God and his Prophets. </p></div>
