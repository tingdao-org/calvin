<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">内中有一个人，赶紧跑去，拿海绒蘸满了醋，绑在苇子上，送给他喝。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>And immediately one ran. </em>As Christ had once refused to drink, it may be conjectured with probability, that it was repeatedly offered to him for the sake of annoyance; though it is also not improbable that <em>the vinegar </em>was held out to him in a cup before he was raised aloft, and that <em>a sponge </em>was afterwards applied to his mouth, while he was hanging on the cross. </p></div>
