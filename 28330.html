<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这固然是他们乐意的。其实也算是所欠的债。因外邦人，既然在他们属灵的好处上有分，就当把养身之物供给他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And their debtors they are, etc. </em>Every one perceives, that what is said here of obligation, is said not so much for the sake of the Corinthians as for the Romans themselves; for the Corinthians or the Macedonians were not more indebted to the Jews than the Romans. And he adds the ground of this obligation, — that they had received the gospel from them: and he takes his argument from the comparison of the less with the greater. He employs also the same in another place, that is, that it ought not to have appeared to them an unjust or a grievous compensation to exchange carnal things, which are immensely of less value, for things spiritual. (<span class="bvs">2Co_9:11</span>.) And it shows the value of the gospel, when he declares, that they were indebted not only to its ministers, but also to the whole nation, from whom they had come forth. </p><p>And mark the verb <span class="lang el-gr">λειτουργὢσαι</span><em>, to minister; </em>which means to discharge one’s office in the commonwealth, and to undergo the burden of one’s calling: it is also sometimes applied to sacred things. Nor do I doubt but that Paul meant that it is a kind of sacrifice, when the faithful gave of their own to relieve the wants of their brethren; for they thus perform that duty of love which they owe, and offer to God a sacrifice of an acceptable odor. But in this place what he had peculiarly in view was the mutual right of compensation. </p></div>
