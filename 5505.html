<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为你们出埃及的时候，他们没有拿食物和水在路上迎接你们，又因他们雇了米所波大米的毗夺人比珥的儿子巴兰来咒诅你们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And because he hired. </em><span class="cite-ref">(306)</span> Although there was a common reason why both nations should not be admitted, yet the number of the verb seems to be changed designedly, because Balac king of Moab hired Balaam; yet, inasmuch as they conspired together, the same crime is justly imputed to the Ammonites. Herein indeed their detestable impiety especially betrayed itself, that by hiring a mercenary man, to launch the thunders of his curse against the people, they sought to overwhelm God by magical incantations. Nor did they err through ignorance, since they obstinately persevered in their madness until Balaam was confounded from heaven. And on this ground it is expressly stated that he was not “hearkend unto,” but that rather his curses and prayers were “turned into a blessing.” Hence it appears how awful is the vengeance which awaits all who of deliberate malice oppose God’s grace and the welfare of the Church. Thus now-a-days no stone is left unturned by the defenders of the Papacy, whereby they may disturb the course of heavenly doctrine, nay, whereby they may altogether silence the Gospel if they could. </p><p>Since another reason for this rejection is plainly signified, it is foolish in some to attribute this sentence upon them to their origin, as if the Ammonites and Moabites were excluded from the Church because they sprang from an incestuous connection. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(306)</span><em>A. V. “They </em>hired.” <em>Malvenda </em>in Poole’s Syn. “<em>Hebrews et conduxit, </em>nempe Moabita.” Ainsworth’s translation is, “because that they met you, etc., — and <em>he hired, </em>etc." </p></div></div>
