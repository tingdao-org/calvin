<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not show them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列人在旷野走了四十年，等到国民，就是出埃及的兵丁，都消灭了，因为他们没有听从耶和华的话。耶和华曾向他们起誓，必不容他们看见耶和华向他们列祖起誓，应许赐给我们的地，就是流奶与蜜之地。</div></div>
