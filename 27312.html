<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我在约帕城里祷告的时候，魂游象外，看见异象，有一物降下，好像一块大布，系着四角，从天缒下，直来到我跟前。</div></div>
