<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>55.</strong><em>Many from that country went up to Jerusalem. </em>It was not absolutely enjoined that they should <em>purify themselves before sacrificing the passover; </em>and, therefore, the Evangelist does not say that <em>all </em>came, but <em>many </em>No unclean person, indeed, was permitted to eat; but I say that this sanctification was undertaken voluntarily and from their own inclination, so that others were not forbidden to eat, though they had not been prepared by such a ceremony before the day of <em>the feast </em></p></div>
