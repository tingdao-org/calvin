<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">祭司侍立，各供其职。利未人也拿着耶和华的乐器，就是大卫王造出来，借利未人颂赞耶和华的。（他的慈爱永远长存。）祭司在众人面前吹号，以色列人都站立。</div></div>
