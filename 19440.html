<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因他在我未出胎的时候不杀我，使我母亲成了我的坟墓，胎就时常重大。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>After having denounced his imprecations on his birth-day, and on the messenger who had wished to convey joy to his father, Jeremiah now expostulates with God. It hence appears how great was his madness; for thus must we speak. But if Jeremiah spared not God, how should he spare a mortal man? There is then no doubt but that he raged furiously against God, for his expostulation is that of a man wholly desperate; he asks, why he was not slain from the womb, as though he did not regard it as a kindness that he came alive into light. But this life, though exposed to many sorrows, ought yet to be counted as an evidence of God’s inestimable favor. As the Prophet, then, not only despised this goodness of God, but contended with God himself, because he had been created a man and brought into light, how great was his ingratitude! </p></div>
