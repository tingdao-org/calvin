<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我的心必因耶和华夸耀。谦卑人听见，就要喜乐。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah. </em>The term <em>soul </em>in this place signifies not the vital spirit, but the seat of the affections; as if David had said, I shall always have ground of boasting with my whole heart in God alone, so that I shall never suffer myself to fall into forgetfulness of so great a deliverance. In the second clause he specifies this as the fruit of his thanksgiving, that the afflicted and miserable shall derive from it ground of hope. The Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">ענוים</span>, <em>anavim, </em>which we have rendered <em>humble, </em>signifies not all the afflicted <span class="cite-ref">(689)</span> in general, but those who, being humbled and subdued by afflictions, instead of breathing the spirit of pride, are cast down, and ready to abase themselves to the very dust. These, he says, shall be partakers of his joy; but not, as some have coldly explained it, simply from a feeling of sympathy, but because, being persuaded that in the example of David, God had given them a general testimony of his grace, their hearts would recover from sorrow, and would be lifted up on high. Accordingly, he says that this joy shall spring from hope, because, having received a pledge of their deliverance, they shall cheerfully have recourse to God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(689)</span> The word <span class="lang he-il">ענוים</span>, <em>anavim, </em>may also be rendered <em>the afflicted. </em>Our author in his exposition combines both the ideas of <em>humble </em>and <em>afflicted. </em></p></div></div>
