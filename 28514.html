<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Art thou bound to a wife? </em>Having stated what would be most advantageous, he adds at the same time, that we ought not to be so much influenced by the advantages of celibacy, that one that is bound by the tie of marriage should shake off the connection. It is therefore a restriction upon the preceding statement, lest any one, influenced by his commendation of celibacy, should turn his thoughts to it, and despise marriage, forgetful of his necessity or of his <em>calling </em>Now in these words he does not merely forbid the breaking up of the connection of marriage, but also represses the dislikes that are wont to creep in, that every one may continue to live with his wife willingly and cheerfully. </p><p><em>Art thou loosed from a wife? </em>This second clause must be taken with a reservation, as is manifest from the entire context. He does not, then, allow to all the choice of perpetual celibacy, but only to those to whom it is given. Let no one, therefore, who is not constrained by any necessity, rashly ensnare himself, for liberty ought not to be lightly thrown away. <span class="cite-ref">(419)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(419)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Car il ne faut pas quitter legerement sa liberte sans y bien penser</span>;” — “For he ought not to abandon his liberty lightly, without thinking much as to it.” </p></div></div>
