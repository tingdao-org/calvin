<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但现今你们既从罪里得了释放，作了神的奴仆，就有成圣的果子，那结局就是永生。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Ye have your fruit unto holiness</em>, <em>etc. </em>As he had before mentioned a twofold end of sin, so he does now as to righteousness. Sin in this life brings the torments of an accusing conscience, and in the next eternal death. We now gather the fruit of righteousness, even holiness; we hope in future to gain eternal life. These things, unless we are beyond measure stupid, ought to generate in our minds a hatred and horror of sin, and also a love and desire for righteousness. Some render <span class="lang el-gr">τελος</span>, “tribute” or reward, and not “end,” but not, as I think, according to the meaning of the Apostle; for though it is true that we bear the punishment of death on account of sin, yet this word is not suitable to the other clause, to which it is applied by Paul, inasmuch as life cannot be said to be the tribute or reward of righteousness. </p></div>
