<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>62.</strong><em>He who, after having put his hand to the plough, shall look back, is unfit for the kingdom of God. </em>We must carefully inquire what this declaration of Christ means. They are said to <em>look back, </em>who become involved in the cares of the world, so as to allow themselves to be withdrawn from the right path; particularly, when they plunge themselves into those employments which disqualify them to follow Christ. </p></div>
