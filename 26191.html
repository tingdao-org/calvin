<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣说，我的食物，就是遵行差我来者的旨意，作成他的工。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>My food is to do the will of him who sent me. </em>He means not only that he esteems it very highly, but that there is nothing in which he takes greater delight, or in which he is more cheerfully or more eagerly employed; as David, in order to magnify the Law of God, says not only that he values it highly, but that it is <em>sweeter than honey</em>, (<span class="bvs">Psa_19:10</span>.) If, therefore, we would follow Christ, it is proper not only that we devote ourselves diligently to the service of God, but that we be so cheerful in complying with its injunctions that the labor shall not be at all oppressive or disagreeable. </p><p><em>That I may finish his work. </em>By adding these words, Christ fully explains what is that <em>will of the Father </em>to which he is devoted; namely, to fulfill the commission which had been given to him. Thus every man ought to consider his own calling, that he may not consider as done to God what he has rashly undertaken at his own suggestion. What was the office of Christ is well known. It was to advance the kingdom of God, to restore to life lost souls, to spread the light of the Gospel, and, in short, to bring salvation to the world. The excellence of these things caused him, when fatigued and hungry, to forget meat and drink. Yet we derive from this no ordinary consolation, when we learn that Christ was so anxious about the salvation of men, that it gave him the highest delight to procure it; for we cannot doubt that he is now actuated by similar feelings towards us. </p></div>
