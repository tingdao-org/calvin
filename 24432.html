<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">她就出去，对她母亲说，我可以求什么呢？她母亲说，施洗约翰的头。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_6:24</span><strong>.</strong><em>And she went out, and said to her mother </em>We need not wonder that Herodias attached so much importance to John’s death. <span class="cite-ref">(367)</span> The conjecture thrown out by some—that she was actuated by revenge,—is not at all probable. It was rather the dread of being cast off that inflamed and tormented her; as it usually happens that, when adulterers are visited with feelings of uneasiness, they become ashamed of their own lust. But she hoped that this crime would bind Herod more closely to her than ever, if the disgrace of a pretended marriage were washed out by the blood of the prophet. That her power might be more secure for the future, she longed for the death of that man whom she imagined to be her only opponent; and this shows us the wretched anxiety by which a bad conscience is always tormented. John was detained in prison, and the haughty and cruel woman might have issued orders that no man should converse with or approach him; and yet she has no rest, but is oppressed with anxiety and alarm, till the prophet be removed out of the way. This likewise serves to show the power of the word of God, that the voice of the holy man, even when shut up in prison, wounds and tortures in the keenest manner the mind of the king’s wife. <span class="cite-ref">(368)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(367)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De ce qu’ Herodias a estime un grand avantage pour elle de faire mourir Iean</span>;” — “that Herodias reckoned it a great advantage to her to put John to death.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(368)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ne laisse pas d’espouvanter asprement, et navrer au vif le coeur de ceste femme</span>;” — “fails not vehmently to alarm and cut to the quick the heart of the woman.” </p></div></div>
