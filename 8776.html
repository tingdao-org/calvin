<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你知道洗鲁雅的儿子约押向我所行的，就是杀了以色列的两个元帅，尼珥的儿子押尼珥和益帖的儿子亚玛撒。他在太平之时流这二人的血，如在争战之时一样，将这血染了腰间束的带和脚上穿的鞋。</div></div>
