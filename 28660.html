<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若一个肢体受苦，所有的肢体就一同受苦。若一个肢体得荣耀，所有的肢体就一同快乐。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Whether one member suffers </em>“Such a measure of <em>fellow-feeling.” ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">συμπάθεια</span><em>,) </em><span class="cite-ref">(761)</span> says he, “is to be seen in the human body, that, if any inconvenience is felt by any member, all the others grieve along with it, and, on the other hand, rejoice along with it, in its prosperity. Hence there is no room there for envy or contempt.” To be <em>honored, </em>here, is taken in a large sense, as meaning, to be <em>in prosperity and happiness. </em>Nothing, however, is better fitted to promote harmony than this community of interest, when every one feels that, by the prosperity of others, he is proportionally enriched, and, by their penury, impoverished. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(761)</span> The term is made use of in this sense by classical authors. Polyb. 22, 11, 12. See Calvin’s <em>Harmony</em>, vol. 2, p. 232. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
