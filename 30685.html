<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这样的人，在你们的爱席上，与你们同吃的时候，正是礁石。（或作玷污）他们作牧人，只知喂养自己，无所惧怕。是没有雨的云彩，被风飘荡，是秋天没有果子的树，死而又死，连根被拔出来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>These are spots in your feasts of charity</em>. They who read, “among your charities,” do not, as I think, sufficiently explain the true meaning. For he calls those feasts <em>charities</em>, (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀγάπαις</span>,) which the faithful had among themselves for the sake of testifying their brotherly unity. Such feasts, he says, were disgraced by impure men, who afterwards fed themselves to an excess; for in these there was the greatest frugality and moderation. It was then not right that these gorgers should be admitted, who afterwards indulged themselves to an excess elsewhere. </p><p>Some copies have, “Feasting with you,” which reading, if approved, has this meaning, that they were not only a disgrace, but that they were also troublesome and expensive, as they crammed themselves without fear, at the public expense of the church. Peter speaks somewhat different, [<span class="bvs">2Pe_2:13</span>,] who says that they took delight in errors, and feasted together with the faithful, as though he had said that they acted inconsiderately who cherished such noxious serpents, and that they were very foolish who encouraged their excessive luxury. And at this day I wish there were more judgment in some good men, who, by seeking to be extremely kind to wicked men, bring great damage to the whole church. </p><p><em>Clouds they are without water</em>. The two similitudes found in Peter are here given in one, but to the same purpose, for both condemn vain ostentation: these unprincipled men, though promising much, were yet barren within and empty, like clouds driven by stormy winds, which give hope of rain, but soon vanish into nothing. Peter adds the similitude of a dry and empty fountain; but Jude employs other metaphors for the same end, that they were <em>trees fading</em>, as the vigor of trees in autumn disappears. He then calls them trees <em>unfruitful, rooted up</em>, and <em>twice dead</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(196)</span> as though he had said, that there was no sap within, though leaves might appear. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(196)</span> “Twice dead” is deemed by some a proverbial expression to signify what is altogether dead; or, as by <em>Macknight</em>, it means that they were dead when professing Judaism, and dead after having made a profession of the gospel. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
