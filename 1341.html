<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Behold, we are my lord’s servants</em>. They had before called themselves servants through modesty; now they consign themselves over to him as slaves. But in the case of Benjamin they plead for a mitigation of the severity of the punishment; and this is a kind of entreaty, that he might not be capitally punished, as they had agreed to, at the first. <span class="cite-ref">(173)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(173)</span> On the whole of this verse, <em>Dr. A. Clarke </em>remarks, “No words can more strongly mark confusion and peturbation of mind. They no doubt all thought that Benjamin had actually stolen the cup.” He also thinks it probable that this very cup had been used by Benjamin at the dinner. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
