<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为这百姓油蒙了心，耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着。恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_13:15</span><strong>.</strong><em>Lest I should heal them </em>In the word <em>healing, </em>Matthew, as well as the Prophet, includes deliverance from every evil; for a people afflicted by the hand of God is metaphorically compared by them to a sick man. They say that <em>healing </em>is bestowed, <span class="cite-ref">(188)</span> when the Lord releases from punishment. But as this healing depends on the pardon of sins, <em>Mark </em>describes appropriately and justly its cause and source, <em>lest they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them </em>For whence comes the mitigation of chastisements, but because God has been reconciled to us, and makes us the objects of his blessing? Sometimes, no doubt, after removing our guilt, he continues to punish us, either with the view of humbling us the more, or of making us more cautious for the future. And yet, not only does he show evidences of his favor by restoring us to life and health; but as punishments usually terminate when the guilt is removed, <em>healing </em>and <em>forgiveness </em>are properly introduced together. It must not, however, be concluded, that repentance is the cause of pardon, as if God received into his favor <em>converted </em>men, because they deserved it; <span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> for <em>conversion </em>itself is a mark of God’s free favor. Nothing more is expressed than such an order and connection, that God does not forgive the sins of any but those who are dissatisfied with themselves. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(188)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ils disent qu’il guarit, et remet en sante</span>;” — “they say that he heals, and restores to health.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(189)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il ne faut pas conclurre par cela que la repentance, ou conversion, soit cause de nous faire avoir remission et pardon de nos pechez; comme si Dieu prenoit a merci ceux qui se convertissent, pource qu’ils en sont dignes, et le meritent</span>;” — “we must not therefore conclude, that repentance, or conversion, is the cause of making us have forgiveness and pardon of our sins; as if God exercised mercy towards those who are converted, because they are worthy of it, and deserve it.” </p></div></div>
