<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Lest such an one should be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow </em>The end of excommunication, so far as concerns the power of the offender, is this: that, overpowered with a sense of his sin, he may be humbled in the sight of God and the Church, and may solicit pardon with sincere dislike and confession of guilt. The man who has been brought to this, is now more in need of consolation, than of severe reproof. Hence, if you continue to deal with him harshly, it will be — not discipline, but cruel domineering. Hence we must carefully guard against pressing them beyond this limit. <span class="cite-ref">(323)</span> For nothing is more dangerous, than to give Satan a handle, to tempt an offender to despair. Now we furnish Satan with arms in every instance, in which we leave without consolation those, who are in good earnest affected with a view of their sin. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(323)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Plus qu’il est yci demonstré</span>;” — “Beyond what is here pointed out.” </p></div></div>
