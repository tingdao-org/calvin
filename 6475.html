<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And, behold, this day I am going, </em>etc As it has been appointed unto all men once to die, (<span class="bvs">Heb_9:27</span>) Joshua says that in regard to himself the common end of all is at hand, inasmuch as he, too, was born mortal. These expressions are evidently adapted to console the people, and prevent them from feeling immoderate grief at the bereavement when he should be taken from them. For there cannot be a doubt that his loss filled the people with the deepest regret, when they saw themselves reduced, as it were, to a mutilated trunk, by being deprived of their head. He therefore admonishes them, that since the race of life is ended by having reached the goal, they were not to ask that his condition should be different from that of the whole human race. Meanwhile he does not intimate that the form of dying is the same in all, because the believers of heavenly doctrine are distinguished from unbelievers by an incorruptible seed, not allowing them in like manner to perish, but only adverts to that which is common, namely, departure from the world after the course of life is ended. The substance of his whole address amounts to this, that as God had proved himself true by his favors and the fulfillment of his promises, so his threatening would not be empty or vain, and he would certainly avenge the profanation of his worship by their final destruction. <span class="cite-ref">(193)</span></p><p><strong>(193)</strong> Latin, “Ultimo eorum interitu.” French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">En les destruisant a toute rigeur</span>;” “By destroying them in all rigor,” (without mercy.) — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
