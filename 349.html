<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又把亚伯兰的侄儿罗得和罗得的财物掳掠去了。当时罗得正住在所多玛。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And they took Lot</em>. It is doubtful whether Lot remained at home while others went to the battle, and was there captured by the enemy; or whether he had been compelled to take arms with the rest of the people. As, however, Moses does not mention him till he speaks of the plundering of the city, the conjecture is probable, that at the conclusion of the battle, he was taken at home, unarmed. We here see, first, that sufferings are common to the good and the evil; then, that the more closely we are connected with the wicked and the ungodly, when God pours down his vengeance on them, the more quickly does the scourge come upon us. </p></div>
