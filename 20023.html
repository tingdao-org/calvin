<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那定意进入埃及地，在那里寄居的，就是所剩下的犹大人，我必使他们尽都灭绝，必在埃及地仆倒，必因刀剑饥荒灭绝。从最小的到至大的都必遭刀剑饥荒而死，以致令人辱骂，惊骇，咒诅，羞辱。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>And first, indeed, the Prophet briefly shews that all those would perish who had yet falsely imagined that they could not otherwise be safe than by fleeing into Egypt. Then Jeremiah here reproves and condemns their false and vain confidence. And then he explains the manner when he says, <em>I will take away all the remnant of Judah, who have set their face to come to Egypt, etc. By </em>these words and the following, God intimates that the Jews had in vain sought hiding-places in Egypt, because there he would inflict on them the punishment which they had deserved. He names the <em>sword </em>and <em>the famine; </em>the third kind he omits here, but he will mention it presently. Then he says that they were to perish, partly by the sword and partly by famine, and in order to speak more emphatically, he uses different words, <em>They shall be consumed by famine, they shall fall by the sword, they shall all be consumed, </em>and then he <em>says, from the least to the greatest. </em></p><p>At length he adds, <em>And they shall be a curse. </em>We have said elsewhere that the word <span class="lang he-il">אלה</span>, <em>ale, </em>sometimes means a curse, though it properly signifies an oath; and the reason is, <em>because </em>men in swearing often introduce a curse, “Let God curse me,” — “Let me perish.” Then he says, that the <em>Jews </em>would become an example of a curse; for in making an oath this would be the common form, “Let God destroy me as he destroyed the Jews.” He afterwards adds, <em>an astonishment, </em>because all would be horrified at the very sight of their calamity. It follows in the last place, <em>a curse and a reproach, </em>of which we have spoken before. <em>Let </em>us now proceed, — </p></div>
