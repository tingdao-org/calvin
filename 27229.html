<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Lord, I have heard. </em>In that Ananias objecteth the danger to the Lord, he betrayeth his weakness of faith therein. Therefore we see that the saints and servants of God are afraid of death, which thing keepeth them back from doing their duty; yea, it causeth them sometimes to stagger. Ananias would gladly go to some other place; but this is a point of a good man, that he yieldeth not so much to fear that he withdraweth himself from Christ’s obedience. And, therefore, this is a sign of rare obedience, <span class="cite-ref">(588)</span> that although through fear of death he were somewhat slack at the first, yet having forgotten himself by and by, he maketh great haste to go whither Christ called him. And yet, notwithstanding, he refuseth not flatly in these words to do that which he is commanded to do, but useth an excuse <span class="cite-ref">(589)</span> very modestly, Lord, what meaneth this, that thou sendest me to the hangman? Therefore we may see a desire to obey mixed with fear. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(588)</span> “Pietatis,” piety. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(589)</span> “Obliqua excusatione,” indirect excuse. </p></div></div>
