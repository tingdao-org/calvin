<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我却使以扫赤露，显出他的隐密处。他不能自藏。他的后裔，弟兄，邻舍尽都灭绝。他也归于无有。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>As to the beginning of the verse, the meaning of the Prophet is not obscure; for he means that such would be the destruction of the people of Edom, that they would be spoiled by enemies, that they would become wholly naked. But he speaks in the name of God: <em>Behold, I uncover Esau, and make open his hidden things </em>By hidden things he means treasures, as it is evident from Obadiah. He then says that he would so expose the Idumeans to plunder, that there would be no hidden thing but that their enemies would seize and plunder it. This is the meaning. </p><p>He then confirms what I have said, that this plundering would not be like grape-gathering, or theft, or common robbery, because God would altogether empty the Idumeans of all that they had, even of all that they hid in the ground. </p></div>
