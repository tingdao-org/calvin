<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们不是驱逐耶和华的祭司亚伦的后裔和利未人吗？不是照着外邦人的恶俗为自己立祭司吗？无论何人牵一只公牛犊，七只公绵羊将自己分别出来，就可作虚无之神的祭司。</div></div>
