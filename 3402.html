<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们不可亵渎我的圣名，我在以色列人中，却要被尊为圣。我是叫你们成圣的耶和华，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>Neither shall ye profane. </em>In forbidding the profanation of His name, He confirms in other words the foregoing sentiment; guarding by them His worship from all corruptions, that it may be maintained in purity and integrity. The same, too, is the object of the clause in apposition, which immediately follows; for they hallow God’s name who turn not away from its rightful and sincere worship. Let this be carefully observed, that whatever fancies men devise, are so many profanations of God’s name; for although the superstitious may please themselves by their imaginations, yet is all their religion full of sacrilege, whereby God complains that His holiness is profaned. Mark, also, the mutual relation, when God requires Himself to be hallowed, even as he hallows the people; for nothing can be more unseemly than for the Israelites to mix up with idols Him by whose blessing they excel all other nations. It is as though He commanded them to reflect from whence their superiority proceeded, that they may pay their debt of gratitude to Him who is its author. In sum, forasmuch as He had separated them from heathen nations, He condemns all wicked blending with them, whereby the integrity of religion is corrupted, so that He may alone have the pre-eminence, and all idols may be repudiated. <span class="cite-ref">(224)</span></p><p><strong>(224)</strong> Addition in French,” Et reboutees bien loin.” </p></div>
