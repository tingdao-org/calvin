<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">The sons of Judah were Er and Onan: and Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">犹大的儿子是珥和俄南。这珥和俄南死在迦南地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>The sons of Judah were Er and Onan. </em>Since the tribe of Judah was so numerous, Moses magnifies the greatness of God’s grace by this circumstance, that of the three sons which he begat, two perished in the land of Canaan, by whose loss he might have appeared to be condemned to perpetual sterility. But the climax of God’s unparalleled mercy was this, that although two of his children were born of an incestuous connection, they grew up into so great a people. </p></div>
