<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>53.</strong><em>They consulted to put him to death. </em>The Evangelist relates that Christ again fled, knowing that his enemies sought him with so great rage. Yet let us remember that he did not fly in order to withdraw from his Father’s calling; for he had no other intention than to present himself to undergo voluntary death at the time which God had appointed. This <em>consultation</em>, which the Evangelist mentions, related not so much to slaying Christ as to find out some method of crushing him. They had already determined to put him to death; it only remained to advise in what way they could carry their resolution into effect. </p></div>
