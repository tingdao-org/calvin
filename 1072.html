<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列人未有君王治理以先，在以东地作王的记在下面。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>These are the kings that reigned, etc </em>We must keep in memory what we have said a little before, that reprobates are suddenly exalted, that they may immediately fall, like the herb upon the roofs, which is destitute of root, and has a hasty growth, but withers the more quickly. To the two sons of Isaac had been promised the honor that kings should spring from them. The Idumeans first began to reign, and thus the condition of Israel seemed to be inferior. But at length, lapse of time taught how much better it is, by creeping on the ground, to strike the roots deep, than to acquire an extravagant pre-eminence for a moment, which speedily vanishes away. There is, therefore, no reason why the faithful, who slowly pursue their way, should envy the quick children of this world, their rapid succession of delights; since the felicity which the Lord promises them is far more stable, as it is expressed in the psalm, </p><p>“The children’s children shall dwell there, and their inheritance shall be perpetual.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_102:28</span>.) </p></div>
