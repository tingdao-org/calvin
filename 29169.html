<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们向来跑得好。有谁拦阻你们，叫你们不顺从真理呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Ye did run well</em>. The censure which the apostle administers for their present departure from the truth is mingled with approbation of their former course, for the express purpose that, by being brought to a sense of shame, they may return more speedily to the right path. The astonishment conveyed in the question, <em>who hindered you? </em>was intended to produce a blush. I have chosen to translate the Greek word<span class="lang el-gr">πείθσθαι, </span><em>obey</em>, rather than <em>believe</em>, because, having once embraced the purity of the gospel, they had been led away from a course of obedience. </p></div>
