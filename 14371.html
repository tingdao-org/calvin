<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为耶和华的言语正直。凡他所作的，尽都诚实。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>For the word of Jehovah is right. </em>As I have just remarked, the Psalmist first sets forth God’s general providence by which he governs the whole world; and he tells us that he so exerts his power in the whole course of his operations, that the most perfect equity and faithfulness shine forth everywhere. Some will have the terms <em>word </em>and <em>work </em>to be synonymous; but I think there is a distinction, and that <em>word </em>means the same thing as <em>counsel </em>or <em>ordinance, </em>while <em>work </em>signifies the effect or execution of his counsel. I grant that here the same subject is repeated in different words, as is the case in other places; but a slight variation will be found in such repetitions, that the same thing may he expressed in various ways. The amount of what is stated is, that whatever God appoints and commands is right; and whatever he brings to pass in actual operation is faithful and true. Meanwhile, it ought to be observed, that the term <em>word </em>is not to be understood of doctrine, but of the method by which God governs the world. </p></div>
