<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">从前犹大列王所立拜偶像的祭司，在犹大城邑的丘坛和耶路撒冷的周围烧香，现在王都废去，又废去向巴力和日，月，行星（行星或作十二宫），并天上万象烧香的人。</div></div>
