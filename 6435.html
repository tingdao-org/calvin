<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">对他们说，你们带许多财物，许多牲畜和金，银，铜，铁，并许多衣服，回你们的帐棚去，要将你们从仇敌夺来的物，与你们众弟兄同分。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Return with much riches</em>, etc As it was formerly seen that the greater part of the two tribes were left in their territories beyond the Jordan, when the others passed over to carry on the war, it was fair that, as they had lived in case with their families, or been only occupied with domestic concerns, they should be contented with their own livelihood and the produce of their own labor. And they certainly could not, without dishonesty, have demanded that any part of the booty and spoil should be distributed among them, when they had taken no share in all the toil and the danger. Joshua, however, does not insist on the strictly legal view, but exhorts the soldiers to deal liberally with their countrymen, by sharing the prey with them. Here some one may unseasonably raise the question, Whether or not the booty was common? For Joshua does not decide absolutely that it is their duty to do as he enjoins; he admonishes them that, after they have been enriched by the divine blessing, it would betray a want of proper feeling not to be liberal and kind towards their brethren, especially as it was not their fault that they did not take part in the same expedition. Moreover, when he bids them divide, he does not demand an equal partition, such as that which is usual among partners and equals, but only to bestow something that may suffice to remove all cause of envy and hatred. <span class="cite-ref">(181)</span></p><p><strong>(181)</strong> The Septuagint alters the tenor of the whole passage by substituting the past tense for the imperative, and making it read not as a part of Joshua’s address, but as the statement of a fact, “They departed with much riches,” etc., and “they divided the spoil of their enemies with their brethren.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
