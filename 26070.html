<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Why then dost thou baptize </em>? By laying down those three degrees, they appear to form a very conclusive argument<em>: if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor a prophet</em>; for it does not belong to every man to institute the practice of <em>baptism</em>. The <em>Messiah </em>was to be one who possessed all authority. Of <em>Elijah </em>who was to come, they had formed this opinion, that he would commence the restoration both of the royal authority and of the Church. The <em>prophets </em>of God, they readily grant, have a right to discharge the office committed to them. They conclude, therefore, that for John to <em>baptize </em>is an unlawful novelty, since he has received from God no public station. But they are wrong in not acknowledging him to be that <em>Elijah </em>who is mentioned by <span class="bvs">Mal_4:5</span>; though he denies that he is that <em>Elijah </em>of whom they foolishly dreamed. </p></div>
