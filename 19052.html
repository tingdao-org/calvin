<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我观看大山，不料，尽都震动，小山也都摇来摇去。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah descends afterwards from heaven to mountains, and says that they <em>trembled</em>, and that <em>all the hills </em>moved or shook; some say, destroyed, but I know not for what reason, for the Prophet no doubt confirms the same thing by another phrase: and as he had said, that mountains trembled, so he also adds, that hills shook; and this is the proper meaning of the verb. Now the reason why he speaks of mountains and hills is evident; for a greater stability seems to belong to them than to level grounds, inasmuch as mountains are for the most part stony, and have their roots most firmly fixed in rocks. Were indeed the whole world to be thrown into confusion, the mountains seem to be so firmly based that no commotion could affect them: but the Prophet says, that they <em>trembled</em>, and that the hills <em>shook </em></p></div>
