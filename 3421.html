<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savor unto the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又要将一岁，没有残疾的羊羔七只，公牛犊一只，公绵羊两只，和饼一同奉上。这些与同献的素祭和奠祭要作为燔祭献给耶和华，就是作馨香的火祭献给耶和华。</div></div>
