<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Today is fulfilled </em>Christ did not merely affirm in a few words, but proved by a reference to facts, that the time was now come, when it was the will of God to restore his ruined church. The object of his discourse was, to expound the prediction clearly to his hearers: just as expositors handle Scripture in a proper and orderly manner, when they apply it to the circumstances of those whom they address. He says that it was <em>fulfilled in their ears, </em>rather than <em>in their eyes, </em>because the bare sight of the fact was of little value, if doctrine had not held the chief place. </p></div>
