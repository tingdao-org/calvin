<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">要被打碎，好像把窑匠的瓦器打碎，毫不顾惜，甚至碎块中找不到一片，可用以从炉内取火，从池中舀水。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And the breaking of it shall be. </em>When a wall has fallen, some traces of the ruin are still to be seen, and the stones of it may be applied to use, and to some extent the wall may even be rebuilt. But here the Prophet threatens that they who are puffed up with obstinacy against God shall perish in such a manner that they cannot be restored, and all that is left of them shall be utterly useless. Accordingly, he employs the metaphor of a potter’s vessel, the broken fragments of which cannot be repaired or put together. These threatenings ought to make a deep impression upon us, that we may embrace with reverence the word of God, when we learn that punishments so severe are prepared for those who despise it; for the Prophet threatens that they shall be utterly destroyed and ruined, and takes away all hope of their being restored. Nor is the threatening groundless; for we see how they that despise God, when they have been twice and three times cast down, still do not cease to raise their crests; for nothing is more difficult than to root out the false confidence from their hearts. <span class="cite-ref">(294)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(294)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
