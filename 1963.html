<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>And when the children of Israel saw. </em>The Israelites manifested some appearance of gratitude in calling the food given them from heaven, <em>Man</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(178)</span> which name means “something prepared;” but if any prefer their opinion who expound it, “a part or portion,” I do not debate the matter, although the former is more correct. Yet, whichever you choose, by this word they confessed that they were dealt with bountifully, because God presented them with food without their having to labor for it; and, therefore, they indirectly condemn their own perverse and wicked murmuring, since it is much better to gather food prepared for them, than to acquire it by the laborious and troublesome culture of the earth. For although this confession was extorted from them by the incredible novelty of the thing, yet at that particular moment their intention was to proclaim God’s loving-kindness. But, since unbelief had clouded their senses, so that they saw not clearly, Moses says that “they wist not what it was.” In these words he rebukes their slowness of heart, because, although previously advertised of the miracle, they were astonished at the sight, as if they had heard nothing of it before. We perceive, then, that they did but half acknowledge God’s mercy; for their gratitude was clouded with the darkness of ignorance, and they were compelled to confess that they did not altogether understand it; and therefore their stupidity is reproved not without bitterness, when Moses tells them that this was the food promised them by God. For, if they had recognized in it the fulfillment of the promise, there was no need of recalling it to their recollection. As to the words themselves, the answer of Moses has misled the Greek and Latin translators, into rendering them interrogatively, <span class="cite-ref">(179)</span> “What is this?” But their difficulty is easily removed; for Moses does not directly state that they inquired about it as of some unknown thing, but expresses their knowledge mixed with ignorance, for the matter was partly doubtful, partly clear; for the power of God was visibly manifest, but the veil of unbelief prevented them from apprehending God’s promised bounty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(178)</span><span class="lang he-il">מן</span>, <em>Man</em>. If this word be referred to the root <span class="lang he-il">מנן</span>, it may mean a prepared thing; if to the root <span class="lang he-il">מנה</span>, it would mean an assigned portion; but in Syriac and Chaldee <em>man </em>is incontestably what, and the LXX. bear testimony to the existence of the same monosyllabic relative in Hebrew by so rendering it here, to which the <em>V. </em>adds its authority, by saying, Man hu? Quod significat, Quid est hoc? <em>C</em>. found the two first interpretations in the notes of <em>S. M</em>. , who makes no allusion to this last rendering. — <em>W. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(179)</span> See margin <em>A. V. </em></p></div></div>
