<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那时，你们要说，我们在你面前吃过喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Thou hast taught in our streets </em>Christ expressly states, that it will be of no advantage to the Jews, that he approached near to them, and permitted them to enjoy familiar intercourse with him, if, when called, they do not answer at the appointed day. But he does not follow out his comparison: for, after having spoken about <em>the master of a house, </em>he now states, without a figure, that he is himself the judge; and indeed the words, <em>thou hast taught in our streets, </em>can apply to no one but himself. We now perceive his design, which was, to warn the Jews not to allow themselves to lose, by their own neglect, the salvation which it is in their power to obtain. </p></div>
