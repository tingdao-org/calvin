<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">祭司进去出了圣所的时候，不可直到外院，但要在圣屋放下他们供职的衣服，因为是圣衣。要穿上别的衣服才可以到属民的外院。</div></div>
