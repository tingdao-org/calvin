<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们既靠圣灵入门，如今还靠肉身成全吗？你们是这样的无知吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Are ye so foolish? </em>Commentators are not agreed as to what he means by <em>the Spirit </em>and by <em>the flesh</em>. He alludes, in my opinion, to what he had said about the Spirit. As if he had said, “As the doctrine of the gospel brought to you the Holy Spirit, the commencement of your course was spiritual; but now ye have fallen into a worse condition, and may be said to have fallen from the Spirit into the flesh.” The flesh denotes either outward and fading flyings, such as ceremonies are, particularly when they are separated from Christ; or it denotes dead and fading doctrine. There was a strange inconsistency between their splendid commencement and their future progress. </p></div>
