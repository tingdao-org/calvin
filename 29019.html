<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>If he must glory. </em>Here we have the conclusion, drawn from all that has gone before — that Paul is more inclined to boast of those things that are connected with his <em>infirmity, </em>that is, those things which might, in the view of the world, bring him contempt, rather than glory, as, for example, hunger, thirst, imprisonments, stonings, stripes, and the like — those things, in truth, that we are usually as much ashamed of, as of things that incur great dishonor. <span class="cite-ref">(869)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(869)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">De toutes lesquelles nous n’avons point de honte coustumierement, que si nous estions vileinement diffamez</span>;” — “Of all which we feel ordinarily as much ashamed, as if we had been shockingly defamed.” </p></div></div>
