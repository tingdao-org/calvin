<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我叔叔的儿子哈拿篾果然照耶和华的话来到护卫兵的院内，对我说，我在便雅悯境内，亚拿突的那块地，求你买来。因你买来是合乎承受之理，是你当赎的。你为自己买来吧。我耶利米就知道这是耶和华的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He then says, that <em>Hanameel his uncle’s son came, </em>as Jehovah had spoken, that he <em>came into the court of the prison, </em>and that he spoke to him as God had foretold. As to the end of the verse, it may seem strange that the Prophet says, that he now <em>knew </em>that the word came from God: for if he before doubted, where would be the certainty as to the prophetic spirit? He had already received a vision; he ought to have embraced what he knew had been foretold to him from above, even without any hesitation: but it appears that he was in suspense and perplexity. It then seems an evidence of unbelief, that he did not put a full and all entire trust in God’s testimony, and was not fully persuaded as to the heavenly oracle, until he saw the whole thing really accomplished. But it is right to distinguish between the knowledge received from the revelation of the Spirit and experimental knowledge, as they say. The Prophet therefore did not then for the first time learn that God had spoken, but as he was confirmed in the certainty of his faith, and in the thing itself, there is no inconsistency; for nothing is taken away from the credit and authority of God’s word, when the reality and experience confirm us; and thus God often has a regard to the weakness of his people. Jeremiah then relied on God’s oracle, and was fully persuaded that he was directed from above to buy the field; but afterwards, when Hanameel came to him, the event was as it were the sealing of the vision: then the truth of God was more and more confirmed in the heart of the Prophet. This, as I have said, was experimental knowledge, which detracts nothing from the credibility of the word, but is rather a help and a comfort to human infirmity. In this sense it was that he said, that he now <em>knew </em>it; and thus he intended also to make others to believe the prophecy. For when the faithful compare a vision with its accomplishment, this consent and harmony, so to speak, avails not a little to confirm their faith, that as when in one part they hear that God had spoken, and when in another they see that what the Prophet had been taught was really fulfilled. <span class="cite-ref">(60)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(60)</span><em>Gataker </em>and <em>Venema </em>give another view of this clause. The Lord, as we find from verse 7 (<span class="bvs">Jer_32:7</span>), did not tell him to <em>buy </em>the field, but only informed him of the coming and offer of Hanameel. When Hanameel came, he knew that it was God’s will that he should buy the field, and he instantly acted accordingly. He knew from the very circumstances that it was God’s message, sent to him to buy the field. — Ed. </p></div></div>
