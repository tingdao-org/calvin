<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>4.<em>Being made so much better, etc. </em>After having raised Christ above Moses and all others, he now amplifies His glory by a comparison with angels. It was a common notion among the Jews, that the Law was given by angels; they attentively considered the honorable things spoken of them everywhere in Scripture; and as the world is strangely inclined to superstition, they obscured the glory of God by extolling angels too much. It was therefore necessary to reduce them to their own rank, that they might not overshadow the brightness of Christ. And first he proves from his name, that Christ far excelled them, for he is called the Son of God; <span class="cite-ref">(17)</span> and that he was distinguished by this title he shows by two testimonies from Scripture, both of which must be examined by us; and then we shall sum up their full import. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(17)</span> Some by “name” understand dignity, but not correctly, as it appears from what follows; for the name, by which he is proved here to be superior to angels, was that of a Son, as Calvin here states. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
