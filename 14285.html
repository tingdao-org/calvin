<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">至于我，却要行事纯全。求你救赎我，怜恤我。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>But I will walk in mine integrity. </em>In this repetition there is to be remarked a circumstance which more clearly illustrates David’s righteousness; namely, that, in the midst of so many temptations, he steadily held on his way. He saw many become suddenly rich by gifts, as we still see those who sit at the helm of affairs accumulating to themselves, in a very brief space, a great abundance of wealth, building sumptuous palaces, and extending their lands far and wide. As no allurements could induce him to imitate their example in this, he gave a proof of rare and heroic virtue. He therefore affirms with truth, that although the world accounted them happy, he had not been seduced from his wonted integrity, that thus it might appear that he ascribed more to the providence of God than to evil practices. He, therefore, beseeches God <em>to redeem him, </em>because, being oppressed with wrongs, and tempted in various ways, he relied only on God, trusting that he would deliver him. From this we may conclude, that he was at this time reduced to great straits. He adds, <em>Be merciful to me, </em>by which he shows that this deliverance flows from the grace of God, as its true source; and we have already seen that the cause is often put for the effect. </p></div>
