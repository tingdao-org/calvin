<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And there was a famine</em>. Moses relates that Isaac was tried by nearly the same kind of temptation as that through which his father Abraham had twice passed. I have before explained how severe and violent was this assault. The condition in which it was the will of God to place his servants, as strangers and pilgrims in the land which he had promised to give them, seemed sufficiently troublesome and hard; but it appears still more intolerable, that he scarcely suffered them to exist (if we may so speak) in this wandering, uncertain, and changeable kind of life, but almost consumed them with hunger. Who would not say that God had forgotten himself, when he did not even supply his own children, — whom he had received into his especial care and trust, — however sparingly and scantily, with food? But God thus tried the holy fathers, that we might be taught, by their example, not to be effeminate and cowardly under temptations. Respecting the terms here used, we may observe, that though there were two seasons of dearth in the time of Abraham, Moses alludes only to the one, of which the remembrance was most recent. <span class="cite-ref">(36)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(36)</span> Abimelech, king of the Philistines, mentioned in this verse, was not he who is spoken of in <span class="bvs">Gen_21:0</span>, but perhaps his descendant. “It is probable the name was common to the kings of Gerar, as Pharaoh was to the kings of Egypt. The meaning of the word <span class="lang he-il">אבימלך</span> is, My father the king. Kings ought to be the fathers of their country.” — <em>Menochius </em>in Poli Syn. </p></div></div>
