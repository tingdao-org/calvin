<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约伯的弟兄，姐妹，和以先所认识的人都来见他，在他家里一同吃饭。又论到耶和华所降与他的一切灾祸，都为他悲伤安慰他。每人也送他一块银子和一个金环。</div></div>
