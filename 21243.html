<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">外邦人，就是列邦中强暴的，将它砍断弃掉。它的枝条落在山间和一切谷中，它的枝子折断，落在地的一切河旁。地上的众民已经走去，离开它的荫下。</div></div>
