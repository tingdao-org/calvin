<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那些日子，我在犹大见有人在安息日榨酒（原文作踹酒榨），搬运禾捆驮在驴上。又把酒，葡萄，无花果，和各样的担子在安息日担入耶路撒冷，我就在他们卖食物的那日警戒他们。</div></div>
