<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我就称赞快乐，原来人在日光之下，莫强如吃喝快乐。因为他在日光之下，神赐他一生的年日，要从劳碌中，时常享受所得的。</div></div>
