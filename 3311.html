<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">不可辱没你的女儿，使她为娼妓，恐怕地上的人专向淫乱，地就满了大恶。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This passage more clearly proves that all unlicensed connections <span class="cite-ref">(64)</span> were always unlawful in God’s sight. It is a tame and forced interpretation to apply what is here said to spiritual fornication; and those also, who suppose that public stews only are forbidden, restrict the law too much, whereas God rather gives a general injunction that parents should preserve their daughters by means of a pure and chaste education. But even although we admit that nothing else is prohibited but that parents should be the panders of their daughters, still we gather from the word <em>pollute </em><span class="cite-ref">(65)</span> (for some render the word <span class="lang he-il">חלל</span>, <em>chalal</em>, too tamely to <em>make common</em>) that they are contaminated by their whoredom, and the reason given abundantly confirms the fact, that all whoredom is hateful to God, “lest the land fall to whoredom, (He says,) and the land become full of wickedness.” It is plain that adultery is not in question here; but God declares it to be criminal if a man and woman have connection out of wedlock. Consequently, the people are taught in the Seventh Commandment to beware of all unchastity. </p><p><strong>(64)</strong> “Toute compagnie d’homme et de femme hors le mariage.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p><p><strong>(65)</strong> Margin <em>A.
