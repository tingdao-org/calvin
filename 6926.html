<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">参孙的妻在丈夫面前啼哭说，你是恨我，不是爱我，你给我本国的人出谜语，却没有将意思告诉我。参孙回答说，连我父母我都没有告诉，岂可告诉你呢？</div></div>
