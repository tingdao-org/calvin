<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_5:10</span><strong>.</strong><em>And entreated him earnestly </em>Luke says, they requested that they might not be sent <em>into the deep </em>Some explain these words to mean that they wished to avoid uninhabited places. <span class="cite-ref">(555)</span> I rather view it as referring to their rage for doing mischief. As the devils have no other object than to prowl among men, like lions in search of prey, they are grieved at being plunged into the deep, where they will have no opportunity of injuring and ruining men. That this is the true meaning may be inferred from the words of Mark, who says that they requested that they might not be compelled to go <em>out of the country </em>In a word, they manifest their disposition to be such, that there is nothing which they more eagerly desire than the destruction of mankind. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(555)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ce qu'aucuns exposent comme si les diables n'eussent point voulu aller en lieu desert</span>;” — “which some explain as if the devils did not wish to go into a desert place.” </p></div></div>
