<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">忽然耶稣遇见她们，说，愿你们平安。她们就上前抱住他的脚拜他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And held his feet. </em>This appears not to agree with the words of John, (<span class="bvs">Joh_20:17</span>,) where he declares that Mary was forbidden to touch Christ. But it is easy to reconcile them. The Lord, perceiving that Mary was too eager to embrace and kiss his fleet, orders her to retire; because it was proper to correct the superstition, and to point out the design of his resurrection, which Mary was withheld from perceiving, partly by an earthly and carnal affection, and partly by foolish zeal. Yet at first the Lord permitted her to touch <em>his feet, </em>that nothing might be wanting to give her a full conviction; and, therefore, Matthew immediately adds, that <em>they worshipped the Lord, </em>which was a proof that they fully recognized him. </p></div>
