<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我必剪除摩押中的审判者，将其中的一切首领，和他一同杀戮。这是耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He finally adds, <em>And I will cut off the judge from the midst of her, and will slay her princes, saith Jehovah. </em>God here declares, that the kingdom of the Moabites and the people shall be no more; for we know that men cannot exist as a body without some civil government. Wherever then there is an assemblage of men, there must be princes to rule and govern them. Hence, when God declares that there would be no more a judge among the Moabites, it is the same thing as if he had said, that their name would be blotted out; for had the people of Moab continued, some princes must have necessarily, as we have said, remained among them. When princes then are destroyed, the people must also perish, for there is no security for them. The Prophet then denounces not here a temporary punishment on the Moabites, but utter ruin, from which they were never to rise. This is the meaning. Let us now proceed — </p></div>
