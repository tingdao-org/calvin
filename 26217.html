<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣看见他躺着，知道他病了许久，就问他说，你要痊愈吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Wilt thou be made whole? </em>He does not inquire about it, as if it were a doubtful matter, but partly in order to kindle in the man a desire of the favor which was offered to him, and partly to quicken the attention of the witnesses who were present, and who, if they had been thinking of something else, might not have perceived the miracle, as frequently happens in sudden occurrences. For these two reasons, therefore, this preparation was necessary. </p></div>
