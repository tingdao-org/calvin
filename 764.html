<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以扫说，他名雅各，岂不是正对吗？因为他欺骗了我两次。他从前夺了我长子的名分，你看，他现在又夺了我的福分。以扫又说，你没有留下为我可祝的福吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>Is he not rightly named Jacob? </em>That the mind of Esau was affected with no sense of penitence appears hence; he accused his brother and took no blame to himself. But the very beginning of repentance is grief felt on account of sin, together with self-condemnation. Esau ought to have descended into himself, and to have become his own judge. Having sold his birthright, he had darted, like a famished dog, upon the meat and the pottage; and now, as if he had done no wrong, he vents all his anger on his brother. Further, if the blessing is deemed of any value, why does he not consider that he had been repelled from it, not simply by the fraud of man, but by the providence of God? We see, therefore, that like a blind man feeling in the dark, he cannot find his way. </p></div>
