<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">利未人见银子多了，就把柜抬到王所派的司事面前。王的书记和大祭司的属员来将柜倒空，仍放在原处。日日都是这样，积蓄的银子甚多。</div></div>
