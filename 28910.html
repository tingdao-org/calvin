<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Ye are not straitened in us </em>That is, “It is owing to your own fault that you are not able to share in this feeling of cheerfulness, which I entertain towards you. My <em>mouth is opened, </em>so that I deal familiarly with you, my very heart would willingly pour itself forth, <span class="cite-ref">(605)</span> but you shut up your bowels.” He means to say, that it is owing to their corrupt judgment, that the things that he utters are not relished by them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(605)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mon coeur mesme s’ouuriroit volontiers pour vous mettre deuant les yeux l’affection que i’ ay enuers vous</span>;” — “My very heart would willingly open itself up, so as to place before your eyes the affection which I entertain towards you.” </p></div></div>
