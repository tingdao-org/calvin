<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Steadfast, </em>or “firm,” or <em>sure</em>, <em>etc.</em>; that is, it was the word of authority, for God required it to be believed; and that it was authoritative, was made more evident by its sanctions; for no one despised the law with impunity. Then firmness means authority; and what is added respecting punishment ought to be understood as explanatory; for it is evident the doctrine of which God shows himself to be the avenger, is by no means unprofitable or unimportant. </p></div>
