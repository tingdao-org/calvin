<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>49.</strong><em>And those who sat at table with him began to say within themselves. </em>Hence we again learn, that ignorance of Christ’s office constantly leads men to conceive new grounds of offense. The root of the evil is, that no one examines his own wretched condition, which undoubtedly would arouse every man to seek a remedy. There is no reason to wonder that hypocrites, who slumber amidst their vices, <span class="cite-ref">(250)</span> should murmur at it as a thing new and unexpected, when Christ forgives sins. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(250)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qui se plaisent et fiattent en leurs vices</span>;” — “who please and flatter themselves amidst their vices.” </p></div></div>
