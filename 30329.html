<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">颂赞和咒诅从一个口里出来，我的弟兄们，这是不应当的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This particular truth ought also to be borne in mind, that severe censors discover their own virulence, which they suddenly vomit forth against their brethren whatever curses they can imagine, after having in sweet strains offered praises to God. Were any one to object and say, that the image of God in human nature has been blotted out by the sin of Adam; we must, indeed, confess that it has been miserably deformed, but in such a way that some of its lineaments still appear. Righteousness and rectitude, and the freedom of choosing what is good, have been lost; but many excellent endowments, by which we excel the brutes, still remain. He, then, who truly worships and honors God, will be afraid to speak slanderously of man. </p></div>
