<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你要对这地的百姓说，主耶和华论耶路撒冷和以色列地的居民如此说，他们吃饭必忧虑，喝水必惊惶。因其中居住的众人所行强暴的事，这地必然荒废，一无所存。</div></div>
