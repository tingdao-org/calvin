<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我将它扔到阴间，与下坑的人一同下去。那时，列国听见它坠落的响声就都震动，并且伊甸的一切树就是利巴嫩得水滋润，最佳最美的树都在阴府受了安慰。</div></div>
