<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">被杀的人必倒在你们中间，你们就知道我是耶和华。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet adds a small clause to his former threats, namely, that God would so consume the whole people with slaughter, that they would be compelled to acknowledge him as Jehovah. <em>The slain, </em>therefore<em>, shall fall in the midst of thee, </em>that is, the enemy shall arise who shall cause slaughter everywhere through the midst of the land. As to the phrase,<em>I am Jehovah, </em>it refers to the prophecy; for the Israelites did not openly deny God, but because they had no faith in the words of the Prophet, hence God appears and confirms and establishes the authority of the prophetic teaching, when he shows that an avenger was at hand if it was despised, as we know it was despised; and this he will soon explain a little more clearly. It follows now — </p></div>
