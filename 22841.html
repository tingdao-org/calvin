<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那时，我必领你们进来，聚集你们。我使你们被掳之人归回的时候，就必使你们在地上的万民中有名声，得称赞。这是耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He repeats the same things, with some change in the words; and not without reason, because no one of them thought that the Jews, who were cast as it were into the grave, would ever come forth again, and especially, that they would be raised unto such dignity and unto so elevated an honor. As then this was not probable, that Prophet confirms his prediction—<em>I will restore you, says God, I will gather you, even because I have given you a name</em>; that is, it is my resolved and fixed purpose to render you celebrated: but here again are laid down the words we have already noticed. </p><p>He afterwards adds—<em>When I shall restore your captivities</em>. The plural number is to be noticed; and not rightly nor prudently is what has been done by many interpreters, who have rendered the word in the singular number; for the Prophet mentions captivities designedly, as the Jews had not only been driven into exile, but had also been scattered through various countries, so that they were not one captive people, but many troops of captives. Hence his purpose was to obviate a doubt; for it would not have been enough that one captivity should be restored, except all who had been dispersed were collected into one body by the wonderful power of God. And hence he adds before your eyes, that the Jews might be convinced that they should be eye-witnesses of this miracle, which yet they could hardly conceive, without raising up their thoughts above the world. </p></div>
