<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那领一千的，也来说，主阿，我知道你是忍心的人，没有种的地方要收割，没有散的地方要聚敛。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>I knew thee, that thou art a harsh man. </em>This <em>harshness </em>has nothing to do with the substance of the parable; and it is an idle speculation in which those indulge, who reason from this passage, how severely and rigorously God deals with his own people. For Christ did not intend to describe such <em>rigor</em>, any more than to applaud <em>usury</em>, when he represents the master of the house as saying, that the money ought to have been deposited with a <em>banker</em>, that it might, at least, <em>gain interest </em>Christ only means, that there will be no excuse for the indolence of those who both conceal the gifts of God, and waste their time in idleness. Hence also we infer that no manner of life is more praiseworthy in the sight of God, than that which yields some advantage to human society. </p></div>
