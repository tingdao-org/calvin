<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Great is Diana of the Ephesians. </em>This was a clamorous confession, but without any soundness; neither did it proceed from the faith of the heart. For whence came that great divinity of Diana whereof they spake, save only because like mad men they furiously defend that error which they had once received? It fareth otherwise with true godliness, that we believe with the heart unto righteousness, and then doth the confession of the mouth follow to salvation. Therein doth the distemperature and mad stubbornness of all mad men and brain-sick fools differ from the constancy and zeal of the martyrs. And yet, notwithstanding, our sluggishness is shameful if we be not as ready and stout in the confession of a sure faith as are they in their filthy error. For we see what the Spirit of God prescribeth unto us by the mouth of David,</p><p><em>“ </em>I believed, and therefore will I speak,” ( <span class="bvs">Psa_116:10</span>). </p></div>
