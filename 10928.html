<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">过了一年，到列王出战的时候，约押率领军兵毁坏亚扪人的地，围攻拉巴。大卫仍住在耶路撒冷。约押攻打拉巴，将城倾覆。</div></div>
