<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们将神像抬起，扛在肩上，安置在定处，它就站立，不离本位，人呼求它，它不能答应，也不能救人脱离患难。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>They shall carry them on the shoulder. </em>The picture is still more heightened by the description contained in this verse; for, since the idols have no feeling of any kind, they who fly to them to ask assistance must be not only very stupid but very obstinate. </p></div>
