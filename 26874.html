<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又看见耶稣的裹头巾，没有和细麻布放在一处，是另在一处卷着。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And the napkin which was about his head. </em>When the Evangelist says, that <em>a napkin </em>was wrapped <em>about his head, </em>this refutes the falsehood of the Papists, who pretend that the whole body was sewed up in one linen garment, which they hold out to the wretched populace, calling it “the holy winding-sheet.” <span class="cite-ref">(194)</span> I say nothing about their gross ignorance of the Latin language, which led them to suppose that the word <em>napkin </em>— <em>denoting </em>what was used for wiping the sweat from the face, such as <em>a handkerchief </em><span class="cite-ref">(195)</span> — <em>signified </em>a covering for the whole body; nor do I say any thing about their impudence in boasting that they have this very <em>napkin </em>in five or six different places. But this gross falsehood is intolerable, because it openly contradicts the evangelical history. To this is added a fabulous miracle, which they have contrived, to this effect, that the likeness of Christ’s body continued to be visible in the linen cloth. I appeal to you, if such a miracle had been wrought, would nothing have been said about it by the Evangelist, who is so careful to relate events which were not of so great importance? Let us be satisfied with this simple view of the matter, that Christ, by laying aside the tokens of death, intended to testify that he had clothed himself with a blessed and immortal life. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(194)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">L’appelant le sainct suaire</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(195)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme pourroit estre un couvre-chef</span>.” </p></div></div>
