<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们恐吓我们，现在求主鉴察。一面叫你仆人大放胆量，讲你的道，一面伸出你的手来，医治疾病，并且使神迹奇事，因着你圣仆耶稣的名行出来（仆或作子）。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>And now O Lord. </em>They do very well extend that unto themselves which they cited concerning Christ; because he will not, be separated from the gospel; yea, what trouble so ever befalleth his members, he applieth that to his own person. And they crave at God’s hands that he will beat down the cruelty of the adversaries; yet not so much for their own sake that they may live quietly and without vexation, as that they may have liberty to preach the gospel in all places. Neither was it for them to desire a life which they might spend idly, having forsaken their calling. For they add, “Grant unto thy servants, O Lord, that they may speak boldly.” And by the way we must note this speech, that the Lord would behold their threatenings. For seeing it belongeth properly to him to resist the proud, and to throw down their lofty looks; the more proudly they brag and boast, the more do they undoubtedly provoke God to be displeased with them, and it is not to be doubted but that God, being offended with such indignity and cruelty, will redress the same. So Ezechias, to the end he may obtain help in extremity, declareth before the Lord the arrogancy of Sennacherib and his cruel threatenings, (<span class="bvs">Isa_37:14</span> and 17.) Wherefore let the cruelty and reproaches of our enemies rather stir up in us a desire to pray, than any whit discourage us from going forward in the course of our office. </p></div>
