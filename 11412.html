<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列众民见王不依从他们，就对王说，我们与大卫有什么分儿呢？与耶西的儿子并没有关涉。以色列人哪，各回各家去吧。大卫家阿，自己顾自己吧。于是，以色列众人都回自己家里去了。</div></div>
