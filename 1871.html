<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">摩西对百姓说，你们要记念从埃及为奴之家出来的这日，因为耶和华用大能的手将你们从这地方领出来。有酵的饼都不可吃。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And Moses said unto the people. </em>He repeats what he had said more at length in the foregoing chapter, respecting the unleavened bread, not so much to instruct as to exhort them; for he had already expressed the matter with so much clearness, that there was no need of further explanation; but it was useful to stimulate them, that they might devote themselves with greater zeal to their duty, and especially lest, after a longer lapse of time, their ardor should, as usual, gradually abate. He therefore exhorts them, that after they cane into the land, they should diligently observe what he had before commanded. And from the context here, it is plain that the two commands as to the sanctifying the first-born, and celebrating the passover, had the same object, viz., that their deliverance should retain the elect people in the special service of the true God. </p></div>
