<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Let a woman learn in quietness</em>. After having spoken of dress, he now adds with what modesty women ought to conduct themselves in the holy assembly. And first he bids them learn quietly; for <em>quietness </em>means silence, that they may not take upon them to speak in public. This he immediately explains more clearly, by forbidding them to teach. </p></div>
