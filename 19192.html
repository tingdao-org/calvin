He then alludes to their mischievous tradition; for the fathers had imbued their children with ungodly errors, and had withdrawn them from God, that their doctrine might become altogether familiar to them. There is then a contrast to be noticed between the knowledge with which the fathers had inebriated their children, and their ignorance of the language of the nations. </p><p>And then as he had said, that they were walking after the hardness of their own heart and after Baalim, he says, <em>I will send a sword after them </em>We hence see that the Prophet in both clauses alludes to the defection of which he had spoken. And he adds, <em>Until I shall have consumed them; </em>and this is added, that they might not promise themselves a temporary or a moderate chastisement.
