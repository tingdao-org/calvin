<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">摩西和以色列的众长老吩咐百姓说，你们要遵守我今日所吩咐的一切诫命。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And Moses, with the elders. </em>This precept is of the same character as those that have preceded it; for, as God would have His precepts written on the door-posts, and on the borders of their garments, so that they might constantly meet their eyes, so also would He have a monument existing at the very entrance of their land, from which the people might learn that they dwelt in it, in order that they might worship God purely. Wherefore, lest by the people’s carelessness the knowledge of the Law should be obscured, or in any way obliterated, God would have its sum inscribed in a conspicuous place. Hence may be gathered the similarity I have adverted to between the private houses of individuals and the whole land. When the precepts were written on the doors, every one was admonished that his house was sacred to God, and the same was the case with the whole land, so that whosoever entered it might know that it was, as it were, the sanctuary of heavenly doctrine, and thus their zeal might be stirred up to the pure worship of God. The object of the plain and distinct writing of the Scripture, referred to in verse 8, was to take away (the excuse of <span class="cite-ref">(237)</span>) ignorance. </p><p><strong>(237)</strong> Added from the French. </p></div>
