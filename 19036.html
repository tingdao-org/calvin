<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因此，你们当腰束麻布，大声哀号，因为耶和华的烈怒没有向我们转消。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet seems not yet to exhort his own nation to repent: a more gracious doctrine will presently follow; but here he only reminds them that a most grievous mourning was nigh at hand; for he saw that they were hypocrites, immersed in their own delusions, and could not be assailed by any fear. Hence he says, that they were greatly mistaken, if they thought themselves safe while God was angry with them. </p><p><em>Gird yourselves in sackcloth, </em>he says, <em>lament and howl; </em>and then follows the reason, <em>because the fury of God’s wrath was not turned away </em>from them. We indeed know, that the ungodly are wont to make God subservient to themselves, as though they could by their perverseness turn aside or drive afar off his judgment, and restrain, as it were, his hand from acting. As, then, hypocrites are insolent towards God, the Prophet says expressly that the fury of his wrath was not turned away: and thus he warns them, that they would be in every way miserable until they were reconciled to God. </p><p>We now understand the design of the Prophet; for he confirms what the last verse contains, when he said that a lion had come forth, and that a desolator was already nigh; yea, he confirms what he had said, for there was no hope to them without having God propitious, and he declares that God was angry. Hence it follows, that all things would prove infelicitous to them. </p></div>
