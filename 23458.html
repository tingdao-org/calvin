<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_10:40</span><strong>.</strong><em>He who receiveth you, receiveth me</em>. A considerable portion of the world may be opposed to the disciples of Christ, and the confession of their faith may draw upon them universal hatred. Yet here is another consolation tending to excite a very great number of persons to treat them with kindness. Whatever is done to them, Christ does not hesitate to reckon as done to himself. This shows how dearly he loves them, when he places to his own account the kind offices which they have received. He is not speaking here about <em>receiving </em>the doctrine, but about <em>receiving </em>the men. The latter meaning, I admit, arises out of the former, but we must attend to the design of Christ. Perceiving that this was exceedingly adapted to support their weakness, he intended to assure them that, if any one would receive them in a friendly manner, and do them kind offices, he would be as highly pleased as if their benevolence had been exercised towards his own person; and not only so, but that in such a sacrifice God the Father would <em>smell a sweet savor, </em>(<span class="bvs">Gen_8:21</span>) </p></div>
