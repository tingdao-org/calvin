<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">心内也不说，我们应当敬畏耶和华我们的神。他按时赐雨，就是秋雨春雨，又为我们定收割的节令，永存不废。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet in other words proves here that the <em>Jews </em>had been justly charged with perverseness: he says, that it did not come to their minds, that they did not think, to fear God. We hence see that all that is said is designed to shew, that the people were no less senseless and stupid, than if they were lifeless elements; nay, that there was more stupidity and more furious madness in their hearts than in any created thing. </p><p>To <em>say in the heart </em>means in Hebrew to weigh, to consider. We should say in Latin, “It did not come to their minds,” (<em>non venit illis in mentem;</em>) that is, “Have they not been so void of common sense, that this thought did not come to their minds, or did not occur to them, <em>Let us fear the Lord? </em>” And here he takes away every pretense of ignorance, that they might not object and say, that they did not worship God through error or want of knowledge: “But ye had eyes,” he says, and ye had ears, and all the faculties belonging to men; God gave you rain; there has been no year in which the earth did not bring forth its fruit for you; when ye eat bread, does not the bounty of God occur to your minds? and yet ye consider not that he ought to be worshipped.” We hence see that he takes away every excuse for their ingratitude by saying, that they had been inattentive to those blessings, which were seen by the eyes, and felt by the hands, and touched by every part of the body. But of the rest we must speak to-morrow. </p></div>
