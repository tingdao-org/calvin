<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And having called his ten servants. </em>We must not inquire anxiously into the number of the servants, or into the sums of money. For Matthew, by expressing various sums, includes a more extensive doctrine, namely, that Christ does not lay on all an equal charge of trafficking, but commits to one a small, and to another a larger sum of money. Both agree in this, that till the last day of the resurrection Christ, in some respects, goes to a distance from his people, but yet that it would be highly improper for them to sit down in idleness and do no good; for each has a certain office enjoined him, in which he ought to be employed, and, therefore, they ought to be diligent in <em>trading</em>, that they may be careful to increase their Lord’s property. </p><p>Luke says simply, that to each he gave <em>a pound; </em>because, whether more or less may be committed to us by our Lord, every man must equally give account for himself. Matthew, as I have said, is more full and copious; for he states various degrees. Let us know that the Lord does not bestow on all indiscriminately the same <em>measure of gifts</em>, (<span class="bvs">Eph_4:7</span>,) but </p><p>distributes them variously as he thinks proper, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">1Co_12:11</span>,) </p><p>so that some excel others. But whatever gifts the Lord has bestowed upon us, let us know that it is committed to us as so much money, that it may yield some gain; for nothing could be more unreasonable than that we should allow to remain buried, or should apply to no use, God’s favors, the value of which consists in yielding fruit. </p></div>
