<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华必击打以色列人，使他们摇动，像水中的芦苇一般。又将他们从耶和华赐给他们列祖的美地上拔出来，分散在大河那边。因为他们作木偶，惹耶和华发怒。</div></div>
