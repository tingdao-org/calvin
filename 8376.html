And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王说，你这些话莫非是约押的主意吗？妇人说，我敢在我主我王面前起誓，王的话正对，不偏左右，是王的仆人约押吩咐我的，这些话是他教导我的。</div></div>
