<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他就下到王宫，进入文士的屋子。众首领，就是文士以利沙玛，示玛雅的儿子第莱雅，亚革波的儿子以利拿单，沙番的儿子基玛利雅，哈拿尼雅的儿子西底家，和其余的首领都坐在那里。</div></div>

Some he names, and then says, that they were <em>all there, </em>and that Michaiah <em>read </em>to them the words which he had heard from the mouth of Baruch when he read to the whole people. </p><p>Now it was not without the wonderful purpose of God that the king at length came to know what had passed in the Temple, in order that his perverseness against God might be detected, as we shall hereafter see. This messenger, indeed, was the means of bringing danger to Jeremiah as well as to his servant Baruch; but the Lord protected them. However, the impiety and the obstinacy of the king were discovered; for when they were all terrified, he despised God and became enraged against his Prophet.
