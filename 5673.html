<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>61.</strong><em>Also every sickness and every plague</em>. This passage confirms what I have said about the plague and the sickness, for the sickness stands first as the <em>species</em>, and then the plague follows, which has a wider meaning, and comprehends all the curses in itself. Still, after he has enumerated so many forms of punishment, he declares that God is armed with yet other weapons to smite them; and assuredly as His blessings are endless and innumerable, so also His power is incomprehensible for avenging the contempt of His Law. Posterity has experienced, and we also even now partly perceive how true these threatenings were; for, as the obstinacy of men has burst forth and exalted itself more and more, so new and unheard of punishments have abounded from God, like a deluge. </p></div>
