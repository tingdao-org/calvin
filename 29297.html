<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以你们要弃绝谎言，各人与邻舍说实话。因为我们是互相为肢体。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Wherefore, putting away lying. </em>From this head of doctrine, that is, from the righteousness of the new man, all godly exhortations flow, like streams from a fountain; for if all the precepts which relate to life were collected, yet, without this principle, they would be of little value. Philosophers take a different method; but, in the doctrine of godliness, there is no other way than this for regulating the life. Now, therefore, he comes to lay down particular exhortations, drawn from the general doctrine. Having concluded from the truth of the gospel, that righteousness and holiness ought to be true, he now argues from the general statement to a particular instance, that <em>every man should speak truth with his neighbour. Lying </em>is here put for every kind of deceit, hypocrisy, or cunning; and <em>truth </em>for honest dealing. He demands that every kind of communication between them shall be sincere; and enforces it by this consideration, <em>for we are members one of another</em>. That <em>members </em>should not agree among themselves, — that they should act in a deceitful manner towards each other, is prodigious wickedness. </p></div>
