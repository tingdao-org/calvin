<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>In the midst of the Church. </em><span class="cite-ref">(43)</span> It hence appears plainly, that the proclamation of God’s praises is always promoted by the teaching of the gospel; for as soon as God becomes known to us, his boundless praises sound in our hearts and in our ears; and at the same time Christ encourages us by his own example publicly to celebrate them, so that they may be heard by as many as possible. For it would not be sufficient for each one of us to thank God himself for benefits received, except we testify openly our gratitude, and thus mutually stimulate one another. And it is a truth, which may serve as a most powerful stimulant, and may lead us most fervently to praise God, when we hear that Christ leads our songs, and is the chief composer of our hymns. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(43)</span> This quotation is made from <span class="bvs">Psa_22:22</span>, and from the Sept., except that the Apostle changes<span class="lang el-gr">διηγήσομαι </span> into <span class="lang el-gr">ἀπαγγελῶ. </span> The words are often used synonymously, only the latter includes the idea of a message, as it literally means to declare something from another. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
