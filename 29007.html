<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">既有好些人凭着血气自夸，我也要自夸了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>Since many glory. </em>The meaning <em>is </em>— Should any one say to me, by way of objection, that what I do is faulty, what then as to others? Are not they my leaders? Am I alone, or am I the first, in <em>glorying according to the flesh? </em>Why should that be reckoned praiseworthy in <em>them, </em>that is imputed to me as a fault?” So far then is Paul from ambition in recounting his own praises, that he is contented to be blamed on that account, provided he exposes the vanity of the false apostles. </p><p><em>To glory after the flesh, </em>is to boast one’s self, rather in what has a tendency towards show, than in a good conscience. For the term <em>flesh, </em>here, has a reference to the world — when we seek after praise from outward masks, which have a showy appearance before the world, and are regarded as excellent. In place of this term he had a little before made use of the expression — <em>in appearance. </em>(<span class="bvs">2Co_10:7</span>.) </p></div>
