<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华造天，地，海，和其中的万物。他守诚实，直到永远。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Who made heaven</em>, <em>etc</em>. By all these epithets he confirms the truth previously stated. For though at first sight it may seem inappropriate to speak of the Creation, the power of God bears most pertinently upon his helping us whenever danger is near. We know how easily Satan tempts to distrust, and we are thrown into a state of trembling agitation by the slightest causes. Now, if we reflect that God is the Maker of heaven and earth, we will reasonably give him the honor of having the government of the world which he created in his hands and power. There is in this first ascription, then, a commendation of his power, which should swallow up all our fears. As it is not enough that God is merely able to help us, but as a promise is farther necessary, to the effect that he is willing and shall do it, David next declares <em>that he is faithful and true, </em>that, on discovering his willingness, no room may be left for hesitation. </p></div>
