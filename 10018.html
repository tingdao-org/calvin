<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们直到如今仍照先前的风俗去行，不专心敬畏耶和华，不全守自己的规矩，典章，也不遵守耶和华吩咐雅各后裔的律法，诫命。雅各，就是从前耶和华起名叫以色列的。</div></div>
