<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约书亚吩咐百姓说，你们要自洁，因为明天耶和华必在你们中间行奇事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And Joshua said, </em>etc Some unwonted manifestation of divine power in bringing assistance behooved to be held forth, lest the backwardness arising from hesitancy might produce delay; and yet, in order that the Israelites might depend on the mere counsel of God, Joshua does not yet plainly point out the special nature of the miracle, unless, indeed, we choose to read what follows shortly after, as forming part of one context. Herein lies the true test of faith, to lean so on the counsel of God, as not to keep inquiring too anxiously concerning the mode of action or the event. As the word <span class="lang he-il">קדש</span> means sometimes to <em>prepare, </em>and sometimes to <em>sanctify, </em>and either meaning is not inappropriate, I thought it best to leave a free choice. For faith prepares us to perceive the operation of God; and in those times, when God manifested himself to men more nearly, they consecrated themselves by a solemn rite; thus we see how Moses, on the promulgation of the Law, sanctified the people as God had commanded. The view taken by some expositors, that the people were thus commanded to purge themselves from defilement’s, merely in order that nothing might impede the passage of the Jordan, seems to be too confined. </p></div>
