<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">为这些事作见证，并且记载这些事的，就是这门徒。我们也知道他的见证是真的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>This is that disciple. </em>Having hitherto mentioned himself in the third person, John now declares that it is himself; that greater weight may be attached to the statements of one who was an eye-witness, and who had fully known all that he relates. </p></div>
