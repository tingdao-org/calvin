<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">巴勒对巴兰说，你一点不要咒诅他们，也不要为他们祝福。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>And Balak said unto Balaam. </em>Here we may behold as in a mirror how wretchedly unbelievers are driven to and fro, so as to alternate between vain hopes and fears, though by their changes of purpose they are still brought back to the same errors, as if their blind passion led them through a labyrinth. When Balak sees that he is deceived in his opinion, he seeks at least that the hireling prophet should neither profit nor injure. This, however, is exactly as if he would have God to lie idle; but presently he recovers his spirits, and endeavors to repurchase the curse, which in his penitence he had abandoned. For this cause he drags Balaam to another place, although he had already discovered that this was in vain. But thus pertinaciously do unbelievers prosecute their wicked efforts: whilst, at the same time, the disquietude which agitates them with doubts is the just reward of their temerity. </p></div>
