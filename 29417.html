<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>He longed after you</em>. It is a sign of a true pastor, that while he was at a great distance, and was willingly detained by a pious engagement, he was nevertheless affected with concern for his flock, and a longing after them; and on learning that his sheep were distressed on his account, <span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> he was concerned as to their grief. On the other hand, the anxiety of the Philippians for their pastor is here discovered. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(154)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour l’amour de luy</span>;” — “From love to him.” </p></div></div>
