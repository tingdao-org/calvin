<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">世上有何民能比你的民以色列呢？你从埃及救赎他们作自己的子民，又在你赎出来的民面前行大而可畏的事，驱逐列邦人和他们的神，显出你的大名。</div></div>
