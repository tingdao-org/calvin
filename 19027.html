<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">从我们幼年以来，那可耻的偶像将我们列祖所劳碌得来的羊群，牛群，和他们的儿女都吞吃了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>They confirm more fully the same complaint, — That God had by manifest proofs shewed the sins of the nation; for he had consumed their labor, that is, whatever they had acquired by labor. He also adds <em>sheep and cattle, </em>and then <em>sons and daughters </em>He does not indeed ascribe this consumption to God; but the mode of speaking is more emphatic, when he says, <em>Shame has consumed the labor of our fathers from our childhood: </em>for by <em>shame </em>he understands wickedness, of which they ought to have been ashamed. The meaning then is, that all the evils they had endured could in no other way be accounted for, inasmuch as the whole was to be ascribed to their wickedness. Our <em>shame, </em>then, <span class="cite-ref">(96)</span> that is, our wickedness, <em>has consumed the labor of our fathers </em>It follows — </p><p><strong>(96)</strong> Rather, “And the shame,” <em>i e , </em>the idol-worship, referred to in the preceding verse; the article ה is prefixed to the noun. This is the view taken by <em>Gataker </em>and <em>Blayney </em>See <span class="bvs">Jer_11:13</span>; <span class="bvs">Hos_9:10</span>. — <em>Ed </em></p></div>
