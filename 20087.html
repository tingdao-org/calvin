<div class="comment-content"><p>Then he adds, <em>Flee, save</em>: this is the crying of distress; for miserable men, as the case is in extreme evils, mutually exhort one another, <em>Flee, save your lives </em>He then compares them to a tamarisk. The word <span class="lang he-il">ערוער</span>,<em>oruor</em>, designates a country, as it is probable, and there were also two cities of this name. However, <span class="lang he-il">ערער</span>, <em>oror</em>, is a tamarisk, as we have already seen in <span class="bvs">Jer_17:6</span>.

It is in this sense, as we have stated, that our Prophet took the similitude in <span class="bvs">Jer_17:5</span> : </p><p>“Blessed,” he says, “is the man who trusts in Jehovah, for he shall be like a tree planted near waters: cursed is the man who trusts in man, and who makes flesh his arm, and withdraws his heart from Jehovah; for he shall be as the tamarisk of the desert;” </p><p>that is, he shall be barren and dry, without any moisture or support. It now follows: — </p></div>
