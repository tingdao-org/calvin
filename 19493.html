<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">却要指着那领以色列家的后裔从北方和赶他们到的各国中上来，永生的耶和华起誓。他们必住在本地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He says, <em>from all the lands to which I shall have driven them, </em>and he says this for two reasons, which we shall presently state. The change of person does not obscure the meaning: <em>Live, </em>he says, <em>does Jehovah, who brought out and led his people from the land of the north, and from all the lands to which I had driven them; </em>but there is no ambiguity in the sense. </p><p>As to the subject itself, it seems that God in the first place intended to remind the Jews of their sins, as this knowledge was to be the way to repentance, or a preparation for it.

But with regard to God, he is both a righteous Judge and a merciful Savior. As, then, death is in his power whenever he punishes men for their wickedness, so also he has life in his hand and at his bidding, whenever he intends to shew mercy. We now, then, perceive what the Prophet had in view in saying that the Jews had been driven away by God. </p><p>He afterwards adds, <em>They shall dwell in their own land </em>It was necessary that the Jews should have been sustained by this support until the coming of Christ, for they saw that they would be in that inheritance which had been promised to the fathers as a pledge of eternal life and of the heavenly kingdom. It now follows, — </p></div>
