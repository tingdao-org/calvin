<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你就对他们说，我在王面前恳求不要叫我回到约拿单的房屋死在那里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He says, “Though they promise thee impunity, trust them not.” Zedekiah feared lest the Prophet should be too credulous, and should freely relate to the counselors what he had said. But he no doubt had reflected on the fact, that the Prophet had already announced the destruction of the city. He then could have hardly hoped for the silence which he required. Hence then it was, that he so earnestly bid him to be careful; and though the counselors should promise that there would be no danger to him, he yet bade him to be silent. <em>Say to them, </em>he said, <em>I humbly prayed the king not to send me back to the house of Jonathan, that I might not die there </em>It was not indeed a falsehood, but this evasion cannot be wholly excused. The Prophet justly feared, and, as we have before seen, he was perplexed and anxious, for that prison was horrible, and it would have been better at once to die than to have been thus buried alive in the earth. But it is certain that he did not come to the king for this purpose, for he had been sent for. Though, then, the Prophet did not expressly or in so many words say what was false, yet it was a kind of falsehood; and what follows, in reference to himself, cannot be excused. </p></div>
