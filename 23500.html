<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那里有一个人，枯干了一只手。有人问耶稣说，安息日治病，可以不可以。意思是要控告他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>They asked him, saying. </em>Mark and Luke say only that they <em>watched </em>what our Lord would do; but Matthew states more clearly that they also attacked him by words. It is probable, that some others had been previously cured on Sabbath-days; and hence they take occasion to ask if he believes it to be <em>lawful </em>for him to do again what he had formerly done. They ought to have considered whether it was a work of God, or of man, to restore a withered hand by a mere touch, or by a single word. When God appointed the Sabbath, he did not lay down a law for himself, or impose upon himself any restraint from performing operations on the Sabbath, when he saw it to be proper, in the same manner as on other days. It was excessive folly, therefore, to call this in question, and thus to prescribe rules for God himself, and to restrain the freedom of his operations. </p></div>
