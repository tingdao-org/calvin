<div class="CUV verse">这样，善行也有明显的。那不明显的，也不能隐藏。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25</strong><em>In like manner also the good works </em>He means, that sometimes piety and other virtues obtain early and speedily their applause among men; so that great men are held in estimation; and that, if it happen otherwise, the Lord will not suffer innocence and uprightness to be always oppressed; for it is often obscured by calumnies, or by clouds, but at length shall be fulfilled the prediction, (<span class="bvs">Dan_12:3</span>; <span class="bvs">Mat_13:43</span>,) that God will cause them to shine forth like the dawn of the day. But we have need of a calm spirit to endure; and therefore we must always consider what is the limit of our knowledge, that we may not go beyond it; for that would be to assume to ourselves the prerogative of God. </p></div>
