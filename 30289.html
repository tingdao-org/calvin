<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为听道而不行道的，就像人对着镜子看自己本来的面目。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23</strong><em>He is like to a man</em>. Heavenly doctrine is indeed a mirror in which God presents himself to our view; but so that we may be transformed unto his image, as Paul says in <span class="bvs">2Co_3:18</span>. But here he speaks of the external glance of the eye, not of the vivid and efficacious meditation which penetrates into the heart. It is a striking comparison, by which he briefly intimates, that a doctrine merely heard and not received inwardly into the heart avails nothing, because it soon vanishes away. </p></div>
