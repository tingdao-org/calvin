<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">犹太人回答说，我们说，你是撒玛利亚人，并且是鬼附着的，这话岂不正对吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>Do we not say well? </em>They show more and more how greatly they are stupified by Satan; for, though they are fully convicted, still they are enraged, and are not ashamed to show that they are utterly desperate. <span class="cite-ref">(243)</span> Besides, though they bring a double reproach against Christ, still they wish to do nothing more than to say in a few words, that he is a detestable man, and that he is actuated by a wicked spirit. The Jews reckoned <em>the Samaritans </em>to be apostates and corrupters of the Law; and therefore, whenever they wished to stamp a man with infamy, they called him <em>a Samaritan. </em>Having no crime more heinous, therefore, to reproach Christ with, they seize at random, and without judgment, this vulgar taunt. To express it in a few words, we see that with effrontery they curse him, as men are wont to do when, infuriated like enraged dogs, they cannot find any thing to say. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(243)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Neantmoins, ils sont enragez, et n’ont pointe honte de se monstrer du tout desesperez</span>.” </p></div></div>
