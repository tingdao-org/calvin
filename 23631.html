<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>They that were in the ship. </em>I understand these words to refer not only to the disciples, but to the sailors and other passengers. So then those who had not yet declared that he was their Master, instantly acknowledge that he is the Son of God, and by this term render to him the honor of the Messiah. Though at that time this lofty <em>mystery </em>was not generally known, how <em>God was </em>to be <em>manifested in the flesh, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Ti_3:16</span>,) yet as they had learned from the prophets, that he who was to be the Redeemer would be called the Son of God, those who under this designation proclaim the glory of Christ, declare their belief that he is the Christ. <span class="cite-ref">(385)</span></p><p><strong>(385)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Declarent qu’ils croyent qu’il est le Christ et le Messins</span>;” — “declare that they believe that he is the Christ and the Messiah.” </p></div>
