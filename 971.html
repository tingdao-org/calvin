<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">雅各说，不然，我若在你眼前蒙恩，就求你从我手里收下这礼物。因为我见了你的面，如同见了神的面，并且你容纳了我。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Receive my present at my hand</em>. This noun may be taken passively as well as actively. If understood actively, the sense will be, “Accept the present by which I desire to testify my goodwill towards thee.” If understood passively, it may be referred to God, as if Jacob had said, “Those things which the Lord has bestowed upon me by his grace, I liberally impart to thee, that thou mayest be, in some measure, a partaker with me of that divine blessing which I have received.” But not to insist upon a word, Jacob immediately afterwards clearly avows that whatever he possesses, is not the fruit of his labor or industry, but has been received by him through the grace of God, and by this reasoning he attempts to induce his brother to accept the gift; as if he had said, “The Lord has poured upon me an abundance, of which some part, without any loss to me, may overflow to thee.” And though Jacob thus speaks under the impulse of present circumstances, he yet makes an ingenuous confession by which he celebrates the grace of God. Nearly the same words are on the tongues of all; but there are few who truly ascribe to God what they possess: the greater part sacrifice to their own industry. Scarcely one in a hundred is convinced, that whatever is good flows from the gratuitous favor of God; and yet by nature this sense is engraven upon our minds, but we obliterate it by our ingratitude. It has appeared already, how labourious was the life of Jacob: nevertheless, though he had suffered the greatest annoyances, he celebrates only the mercy of God. </p></div>
