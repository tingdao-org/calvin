<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest </em>As no man will of himself become a sincere and faithful minister of the gospel, and as none discharge in a proper manner the office of teacher but those whom the Lord raises up and endows with the gifts of his Spirit, whenever we observe a scarcity of pastors, we must raise our eyes to him to afford the remedy. There never was greater necessity for offering this prayer than during the fearful desolation of the church which we now see every where around us. </p></div>
