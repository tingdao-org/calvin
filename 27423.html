<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>He heard Paul speak. </em>Hearing is set down first, that we may know that the faith which Luke will commend by and by was conceived of Paul’s doctrine. Therefore, when he heard Paul, he hoped to be healed. But the question is, whether this was promised to him specially; for God doth not command us to hope for everything by and by,<span class="cite-ref">(16)</span> when he offereth unto us eternal salvation in the gospel. I answer, that this was a singular and extraordinary motion of the Spirit of God in the cripple, as it was on the other side in Paul, when he knew his faith by beholding him only. It may be that many may receive the gospel, and yet they shall not be cured of those diseases wherewith they are vexed. But forasmuch as God was determined to show a token of his grace in the cripple, he prepared his mind before, and made him capable of this that should come upon him.<span class="cite-ref">(17)</span> Wherefore we must not make this a common rule, because the cripple believed that he should be healed, but it was a peculiar preparation to receive the gift of healing. And this kind of faith is likewise particular which giveth place to<span class="cite-ref">(18)</span> miracles, which many of God’s children do want, who are, notwithstanding, indued with the Spirit of adoption.</p><p><em>Whom when Paul beheld steadfastly. </em>We know how doubtful and how deceitful a thing the countenance of man is, therefore there could no sure judgment be given thereby of faith, which hath God alone to be witness thereof; but, as I have already said, the cripple’s faith was revealed to Paul by the secret inspiration of the Spirit, as he was to the apostles their only guide and master to work miracles.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(16)</span></p><p>“ Protinus,” forthwith. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(17)</span></p><p>“ Hujus accessionis,” of this accession. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(18)</span></p><p>“ Locum,” room for. </p></div></div>
