<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20</strong><em>Blessed be God! who hath not turned away my prayer </em>He concludes the psalm, as he began it, with thanksgiving, and gives the reason of his not having met with a repulse; or, to take the figurative expression which he employs, of God’s not having <em>turned away his prayer. </em>This was, that he had not withdrawn his mercy. For it is entirely of his free grace that he is propitious, and that our prayers are not wholly ineffectual. </p></div>
