<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我必使他们倚靠我，得以坚固。一举一动必奉我的名。这是耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here at length he includes the substance of what we have noticed, that there would be sufficient help in God to raise up and support his people, and to render them victorious over all their enemies. He had already proved this by saying, that God had formerly sufficiently testified by many miracles how much superior he was to the whole world; but he briefly completes the whole of this proof, and shows, that the Jews, provided that they relied on God and expected from him what he had promised, would be sufficiently strong, though the whole power of the world were to rise up against them. </p><p>He also mentions the name of God, <em>They shall walk</em>, he says, <em>in his name</em>, that is, under his auspices. In short, there is here an implied contrast between the name of God and the wealth and the forces of their enemies, which might have filled the minds of the faithful with fear, and cast them down. Hence the Prophet bids the Jews to give the glory to God, and not to doubt but that they would be victorious, whatever hindrance the world might throw in their way. And by this word walk, he means a continued course of life, as though he had said, that the people indeed had returned from exile, that is, in part; but that more of them were to be expected, for the Lord had not only been a leader in their return, but that he would be also their perpetual guardian, and defend them to the end. </p></div>
