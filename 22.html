<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神就赐福给这一切，说，滋生繁多，充满海中的水。雀鸟也要多生在地上。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And God blessed them </em>What is the force of this benediction he soon declares. For God does not, after the manner of men, pray that we may be blessed; but, by the bare intimation of his purpose, effects what men seek by earnest entreaty. He therefore blesses his creatures when he commands them to increase and grow; that is, he infuses into them fecundity by his word. But it seems futile for God to address fishes and reptiles. I answer, this mode of speaking was no other than that which might be easily understood. For the experiment itself teaches, that the force of the word which was addressed to the fishes was not transient, but rather, being infused into their nature, has taken root, and constantly bears fruit. </p></div>
