<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你在犹大人眼前要用手拿几块大石头，藏在砌砖的灰泥中，就是在答比匿法老的宫门那里，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He was then commanded to take <em>great stones, </em>and to <em>hide </em>them in <em>the clay, </em>or cement, <em>in a brick-kiln, </em>that is, in a kiln where bricks were burnt, or in a place where they were usually made, or where materials were taken to form them. And this place was not far from the palace of the king in the city of Taphnees, as the Prophet expressly declares; nay, he says that it was nigh the gate. As, then, this place was near the palace, the Prophet was bidden to hide there the stones, and in the sight of the Jews. This was the symbol. Now, it is shewn for what end God would have the stones to be fixed in the clay or cement; for if the stones were only rolled there with great labor by the Prophet, there would have been no instruction; and all signs we know are unmeaning and without any importance without the word. It is God’s word, then, that in a manner gives life to signs, and applies them for the benefit and instruction of men. Therefore God’s command is added, that he was to speak to the Jews: <em>Thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah. </em>He brings in God as the speaker, that the threatening might be more effectual, as it has been stated elsewhere; for if he had only related the words of God, he could not have thus arrested their attention, which was very tardy. This, then, is the reason why he speaks in the person of God himself. </p></div>
