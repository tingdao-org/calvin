<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们将薄荷，茴香，芹菜，献上十分之一。那律法上更重的事，就是公义，怜悯，信实，反倒不行了。这更重的是你们当行的；那也是不可不行的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_23:23</span><strong>.</strong><em>The former you ought to have done. </em>This is intended to anticipate their calumny; for they might have put an unfavorable interpretation on his discourse, and charged him with setting no value on what the Law of God had enjoined. He therefore acknowledges that whatever God has enjoined ought to be performed, and that no part of it ought to be omitted, but maintains that zeal for the whole Law is no reason why we ought not to insist chiefly on <em>the principal points. </em>Hence he infers that they overturn the natural order who employ themselves in the smallest matters, when they ought rather to have begun with <em>the principal points; </em>for <em>tithes </em>were only a kind of appendage. Christ therefore affirms that he has no intention to lessen the authority even of the smallest commandments, though he recommends and demands due order in keeping the Law. It is therefore our duty to preserve entire the whole Law, which cannot be violated in any part without contempt for its Author; for He who has forbidden us to commit adultery, and to kill, and to steal, has likewise condemned all impure desire. Hence we conclude that all the commandments are so interwoven with each other, that we have no right to detach one of them from the rest. Wherefore it is also written, </p><p>Cursed is every one that performeth not all things that are written, (<span class="bvs">Deu_27:26</span>; <span class="bvs">Gal_3:10</span>;) </p><p>by which words the righteousness of the whole Law, without exception, is enforced. But this reverence, as we have said, does not take away the distinction between the commandments, or the true design of the Law, to which those who truly observe it direct their mind, that they may not merely amuse themselves on the surface. </p></div>
