<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>And Moses called all Israel. </em>Since the plan and order of exposition which I have adopted required that this same preface, as it is repeated word. for word in Deuteronomy, should here also be read together, I have thought fit also to insert the five verses, which in this place precede it. In the first verse, Moses exhorts the people to hear the judgments and statutes of God, which he sets before them. He likewise states the object of this, that they should keep <span class="cite-ref">(222)</span> to do them; as much as to say, that he was not offering them mere empty speculations, which it was enough to understand with the mind, and to talk about, but that the rule for the ordering of their lives was also contained in his teaching; and, therefore, that it demands imperatively their serious meditation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(222)</span> So in margin <em>A.V. </em></p></div></div>
