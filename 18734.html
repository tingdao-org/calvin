<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大山可以挪开，小山可以迁移。但我的慈爱必不离开你，我平安的约也不迁移。这是怜恤你的耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>For the mountains shall indeed be moved. </em>He confirms the former statement, and declares that sooner shall the whole world be turned upside down, than his mercy shall fail. It would be idle to put the question here, how “the mountains shall be moved, or the hills shall shake;” for the comparison is drawn from those things which appear to be strongest and most deeply rooted, in order to show that the foundation of the Church is far more durable. “Mountains” are very strong, and earthquakes do not so frequently take place in them as in plains; and therefore the Lord declares that, although that vast and huge mass of “mountains be moved,” or the heavens fall, yet his covenant shall endure, and his mercy towards the Church shall not fail. In this sense it is said in the Psalm, “The Lord shall reign, the world shall be established.” (<span class="bvs">Psa_93:1</span>) In another passage it is even said, </p><p>“Though the heavens pass away, the Church of God shall remain unshaken.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Psa_102:26</span>) </p><p><em>My mercy. </em>In the word “mercy,” it ought to be remarked what is the nature of the foundation of the covenant; for we can have no friendship with God: unless he have mercy upon us, and receive us by free grace. <span class="cite-ref">(71)</span></p><p><em>The covenant of my peace. </em>He calls it “the covenant of peace,” because the Lord offers to us all that belongs to perfect happiness; as the Hebrew writers also, under the word “peace,” include all posterity. Since therefore this covenant contains solid and perfect happiness, it follows that all who are excluded from it are miserable. </p><p><em>Saith Jehovah, who hath compassion on thee. </em>By saying that it is he “who hath compassion” on her, he again confirms what was formerly said, that he will be reconciled in no other way, and for no other reason, than because he is compassionate and ready to pardon. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(71)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">S’il ne nous recoit gratuitement, en pardonnant nos offenses</span>;” “Unless he receive us through free grace, by pardoning our offenses.” </p></div></div>
