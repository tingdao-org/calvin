<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">城被攻破，一切兵丁就在夜间从靠近王园两城中间的门，出城逃跑。迦勒底人正在四围攻城。他们就往亚拉巴逃去。</div></div>
