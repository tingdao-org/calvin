<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但你们若按外貌待人，便是犯罪，被律法定为犯法的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>When, in the second place, he says, that those who had respect of persons were <em>convinced</em>, or <em>reproved </em>by the law, the law is taken according to its proper meaning. For since we are bidden by God’s command to embrace all mortals, every one who, with a few exceptions, rejects all the rest, breaks the bond of God, and inverts also his order, and is, therefore, rightly called a transgressor of the law. </p></div>
