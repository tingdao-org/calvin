<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们的王和首领，必一同被掳去。这是耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He finally adds, <em>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together </em>As <span class="lang he-il">מלכם</span>, <em>melcam, </em>was an idol of the people, some regard it here as a proper name; but he says, <span class="lang he-il">מלכם הוא ושריו</span>, <em>melcam eva ushariu</em>, ‘their king, he and his princes;’ hence the Prophet, no doubt, names the king of Ammon, for he joins with him his princes. He says then that the ruin of the kingdom would be such, that the king himself would be led captive by the Assyrians. This prediction was no doubt fulfilled, though there is no history of it extant. </p></div>
