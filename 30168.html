<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以你们不可丢弃勇敢的心，存这样的心必得大赏赐。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>Cast not away, therefore, etc. </em>He shows what especially makes us strong to persevere, even the retaining of confidence; for when that is lost, we lose the recompense set before us. It hence appears that confidence is the foundation of a godly and holy life. By mentioning <em>reward, </em>he diminishes nothing from the gratuitous promise of Salvation; for the faithful know that their labor is not vain in the Lord in such a way that they still rest on God’s mercy alone. But it has been often stated elsewhere how reward is not incompatible with the gratuitous imputation of righteousness. </p></div>
