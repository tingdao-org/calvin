<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若点火焚烧荆棘，以致将别人堆积的禾捆，站着的禾稼，或是田园，都烧尽了，那点火的必要赔还。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>If fire break out and catch in thorns</em>. This injury is somewhat different from the foregoing, for he who kindles the fire is commanded to make good the damage done by him, although there may have been no willful intention to do harm. For the incendiary who had maliciously destroyed either a cornfield or a vineyard was to be far more severely punished; here, however, mere carelessness is punished. Although no mention is made either of house or barn, still the law includes all similar cases requiring compensation from him who had kindled a fire even in an open field. But it seems that such a person would be blameless, because he could not. foresee that the fire would ignite the thorns; yet, in order that every one should take as much care of the property of another as of his own, God commands him to suffer the penalty of his heedless or stupid negligence. </p></div>
