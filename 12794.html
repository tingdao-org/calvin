<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他的妻细利斯和他一切的朋友对他说，不如立一个五丈高的木架，明早求王将末底改挂在其上，然后你可以欢欢喜喜地随王赴席。哈曼以这话为美，就叫人做了木架。</div></div>
