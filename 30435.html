<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Let him seek peace </em>It is not enough to embrace it when offered to us, but it ought to be followed when it seems to flee from us. It also often happens, that when we seek it as much as we can, others will not grant it to us. On account of these difficulties and hindrances, he bids us to seek and pursue it. </p></div>
