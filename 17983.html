<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这是耶和华从前论摩押的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>This is the word. </em>This concluding sentence is the ratification of the prophecy. It means that he has pronounced the decree of God himself, and that he has brought nothing forward that did not proceed from the Lord, and thus, laying aside the person of a man, he introduces God speaking in this manner. </p></div>
