<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">过了第一层，第二层监牢，就来到临街的铁门。那门自己开了。他们出来，走过一条街，天使便离开他去了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>When they were past. </em>God was able to have carried Peter away in the turning of an hand; <span class="cite-ref">(758)</span> but he overcometh diverse straits one after another, that the glory of the miracle might be the greater. So he created the world in six days, (<span class="bvs">Gen_1:0</span>.) not because he had any need of space of thee, but that he might the better stay us in the meditating upon his works, (<span class="bvs">Exo_20:11</span>,) for he applieth the manner of doing unto our capacity, and unto the increase of faith. If Peter had at a sudden been carried unto the house where the brethren were assembled, then should one only deliverance have been acknowledged, but now we see, as it were with our eyes, that he was delivered more than ten times. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(758)</span> “Momento uno,” in one moment. </p></div></div>
