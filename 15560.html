<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>He hath not dealt with us after our sins </em>The Psalmist here proves from experience, or from the effect, what he has stated concerning the Divine character; for it was entirely owing to the wonderful forbearance of God that the Israelites had hitherto continued to exist. Let each of us, as if he had said, examine his own life; let us inquire in how many ways we have provoked the wrath of God? or, rather, do we not continually provoke it? and yet he not only forbears to punish us, but bountifully maintains those whom he might justly destroy. </p></div>
