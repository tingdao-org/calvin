<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又在耶路撒冷使巧匠作机器，安在城楼和角楼上，用以射箭发石。乌西雅的名声传到远方。因为他得了非常的帮助，甚是强盛。</div></div>
