<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>He was baptized, and all his household. </em>Luke doth again commend the godly zeal of the keeper, that he did consecrate all his whole house to the Lord; wherein doth also appear the grace of God, in that he brought all his whole family unto a godly consent. And we must also note the notable exchange: he was of late about to murder himself, because he thought that Paul and the rest were escaped; but now laying aside all fear, he bringeth them home.<span class="cite-ref">(223)</span> So that we see how faith doth animate and encourage those to behave themselves stoutly who before had no heart. And surely, when we droop<span class="cite-ref">(224)</span> through fear and doubtfulness, there is no better matter of boldness than to be able to cast all our cares into God’s bosom; that no danger may terrify us from doing our duty, whilst that we look for an end at God’s hand, such as he shall see to be most profitable.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(223)</span></p><p>“ Sponte,” of his own accord. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(224)</span></p><p>“ Torpeamus,” become torpid. </p></div></div>
