<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华如此说，尼尼微虽然势力充足，人数繁多，也被剪除，归于无有。犹大阿，我虽然使你受苦，却不再使你受苦。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet pursues here the same subject; but expresses more clearly what might have been doubtful, — that whatever strength there might be in the Assyrians, it could not resist the coming of God’s vengeance. For <em>thus saith Jehovah, Though they be quiet and also strong, </em>etc. I cannot now finish this subject, but will only say this, — The Prophet intimates that though Nineveh promised to itself a tranquil state, because it was well fortified, and had a wide and large extent of empire, yet this thy peace, he says, or this thy confidence and security, shall not be an impediment, that the hand of God should not be extended to thee. <em>Though, </em>then, they be many or strong etc.; for we can render <span class="lang he-il">רבים</span>, <em>rebim, </em>strong as well as many; but either would suit this place; for we understand the Prophet’s meaning to be, that all God’s enemies would be cut off, however secure they might be, while depending on their own strength and fortresses. The rest to-morrow. </p></div>
