<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>52.</strong><em>And not for that nation only. </em>The Evangelist means that the reconciliation effected by Christ is also extended to the Gentiles. But how comes it that they who, in consequence of being wretchedly scattered and wandering, became the enemies of God, are here called <em>the children of God </em>? I answer, as has been already said, God had in his breast <em>children</em>, who in themselves were wandering and lost sheep, or rather who were the farthest possible from being sheep, but, on the contrary, were wolves and wild beasts. It is therefore by election that he reckons as <em>the children of God</em>, even before they are called, those who at length begin to be manifested by faith both to themselves and to others. </p></div>
