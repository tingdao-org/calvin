<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在该撒利亚下了船，就上耶路撒冷去问教会安，随后下安提阿去。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>When he came down to Caesarea. </em>Though Luke saith in a word that Paul saluted the Church at Jerusalem, yet is it certain that he was drawn thither with some great necessity. And yet we may gather by this text that he stayed not long at Jerusalem, peradventure because things fell not out as he would. Moreover, he declareth that his journey in his return was not idle or barren, in that he saith that he strengthened all the disciples, undoubtedly not without great pains-taking, because he was enforced to go hither and thither, and oft to turn out of his way; for this word [ <span class="lang el-gr">καθεξης</span> ] doth signify a continual course. Now, we have already declared ( <span class="bvs">Act_9:36</span>) in what respect those be called disciples who had given their names to Christ, and professed the name of Christ; to wit, because there is no godliness without true instruction. They had, indeed, their pastors under whom they might profit. Yet the greater Paul’s authority was, and the more excellent spirit he had given him, so they were not a little strengthened by his by them, especially seeing he was the chief work-master in the founding of all these churches. </p></div>
