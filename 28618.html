<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>When ye come together in the Church, I hear there are divisions </em>Some take the words <em>divisions </em>and <em>heresies</em>, as referring to that disorder (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀταξίαν</span>) of which he speaks soon afterwards. I consider them as having a more extensive signification, and certainly it is not likely that he would employ terms so improper and unsuitable for the purpose of exposing that abuse. <span class="cite-ref">(647)</span> For as to their alleging that he has expressed himself in more severe terms, with the view of exposing more fully the heinousness of the offense, I would readily grant this, if the meaning corresponded. It is, then, a reproof of a general kind — that they were not of one accord as becomes Christians, but every one was so much taken up with his own interests, that he was not prepared to accommodate himself to others. Hence arose that abuse, as to which we shall see in a little — hence sprung ambition and pride, so that every one exalted himself and despised others — hence sprung carelessness as to edification — hence sprung profanation of the gifts of God. </p><p>He says that he <em>partly believes it</em>, that they might not think that he charged them all with this heinous crime, and might accordingly complain, that they were groundlessly accused. In the meantime, however, he intimates that this had been brought to him not by mere vague rumor, but by credible information, such as he could not altogether discredit. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(647)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il leur remonstrera qu’ils fout en la Cene</span>;” — “Which he will show that they have fallen into as to the Supper.” </p></div></div>
