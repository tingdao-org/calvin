<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当耶和华你神赐福与你的时候，耶和华你神所选择要立为他名的地方若离你太远，那路也太长，使你不能把这物带到那里去，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24</strong><em>And if the way be too long. </em>I am prevented from understanding this restriction as having reference to the tithes, by the ordinance which is elsewhere made, that whosoever would redeem them by a money-payment, (<span class="bvs">Lev_27:31</span>,) should add a fifth part, and this is omitted here; and, again, by the explanation which is soon after added, that they should bring money with them instead of their offerings, and buy with it oxen and sheep, wine, and strong drink, as they pleased. The sum is, that if it were too burdensome for them to bring from their distant homes victims and other gifts, they were permitted to buy at Jerusalem whatever they chose to offer, provided they made no offerings elsewhere. </p></div>
