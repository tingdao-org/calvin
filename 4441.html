<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这民起来，仿佛母狮，挺身，好像公狮，未曾吃野食，未曾喝被伤者之血，决不躺卧。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion. </em>This comparison is not in every respect accurate; for it does not signify that the Israelites should be cruel or rapacious, but merely bold and strong, and prompt in their resistance if any should provoke them. In the next chapter, it will occur again with a slight change in the words. What Balaam here predicates generally of the whole people, is applied in the blessings of Jacob to the tribe of Judah alone, (<span class="bvs">Gen_49:9</span>,) because it especially excelled in bravery. The sum is, that however the people of Israel might be attacked on every side, it should be endued with invincible fortitude, to overcome all assaults, or to repel them vigorously. Let us, finally, remember that this courage, wherewith Israel was to defend itself against all its enemies, was counted amongst the gifts of God; as: if Balaam had said that they should be preserved by the help of God. </p></div>
