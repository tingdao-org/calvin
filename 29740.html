<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">要存清洁的良心，固守真道的奥秘。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>Holding the mystery of faith </em>As if he had said, “Holding the pure doctrine of religion, and that from the heart, with a sincere fear of God;” or, “Being well instructed in the faith, so as not to be ignorant of anything which it is necessary for Christians to know.” He gives to the sum of Christian doctrine the honorable appellation of <em>a mystery; </em>as indeed God, through the gospel, reveals to men on earth a wisdom which angels in heaven behold with admiration, and, therefore, we need not wonder if it exceed human capacity. </p><p>Let us therefore remember that it ought to be embraced with the deepest reverence; and because we could never, by our own strength, ascend to such a height, let us humbly entreat God to impart it to us by the Spirit of revelation. On the other hand, when we see wicked men either ridicule those doctrines or have no relish for them, let us acknowledge that it is owing to the grace of God that those things which have been hidden from others are in our hearts, and before our eyes, as Moses says, (<span class="bvs">Deu_30:11</span>.) </p><p>Thus he wishes that deacons should be well instructed in “the mystery of faith;” because, although they do not hold the office of <em>teaching</em>, yet it would be exceedingly absurd to hold a public office in the Church, while they were ill informed in the Christian faith, more especially since they must frequently be laid under the necessity of administering advice and consolation, if they do not choose to neglect their duties. It is added, <em>in a pure conscience, </em>which extends to the whole life, but chiefly that they may know how to obey God. </p></div>
