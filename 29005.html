<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>I say again </em>The Apostle has a twofold design. He has it partly in view to expose the disgusting vanity of the false Apostles, inasmuch as they were such extravagant trumpeters of their own praises; and farther, to expostulate with the Corinthians, because they shut him up to the necessity of glorying, contrary to the inclinations of his own mind. “<em>I say again,” </em>says he. For he had abundantly shown previously, that there was no reason, why he should be despised. He had also shown at the same time, that he was very unlike others, and therefore ought not to have his grounds of glorying estimated according to the rule of their measure. Thus he again shows, for what purpose he had hitherto gloried — that he might clear his apostleship from contempt; for if the Corinthians had done their duty, he would not have said one word as to this matter. </p><p><em>Otherwise now as a fool </em>“If I am reckoned by you a <em>fool, </em>allow me at least to make use of my right and liberty — that is, to speak foolishly after the manner of fools.” Thus he reproves the false Apostles, who, while they were exceedingly silly in this respect,were not merely borne with by the Corinthians, but were received with great applause. He afterwards explains what kind of folly it is — the publishing of his own praises. While they did so without end and without measure, he intimates that it was a thing to which he was unaccustomed; for he says, <em>for a little while </em>For I take this clause as referring to time, so that the meaning is, that Paul did not wish to continue it long, but assumed, as it were, for the moment, the person of another, and immediately thereafter laid it aside, as we are accustomed to pass over lightly those things that are foreign to our object, while fools occupy themselves constantly (<span class="lang el-gr">ἐν παρέργοις)</span><span class="cite-ref">(837)</span><em>in matters of inferior moment. </em></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(837)</span> The term <span class="lang el-gr">παρέργον </span> denotes — a matter of mere secondary importance. Thus Thucydides (6:58) says, <span class="lang el-gr">ὁς οὐκ ἐκ παρέργου τὸν πόλεμον ἐποιεῖτο </span> — who did not make the war a secondary consideration. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
