<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在他还没有上丘坛吃祭物之先，你们一进城必遇见他。因他未到，百姓不能吃，必等他先祝祭，然后请的客才吃。现在你们上去，这时候必遇见他。</div></div>
