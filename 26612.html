<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>If I be lifted up</em>. Next follows the method by which <em>the judgment </em>shall be conducted; namely, Christ, being <em>lifted up </em>on the cross, shall gather all men to himself, in order that he may raise them from earth to heaven. The Evangelist says, that Christ pointed out the manner of his death; and, therefore, the meaning undoubtedly is, that the cross will be, as it were, a chariot, by which he shall raise all men, along with himself, to his Father. It might have been thought, that at that time he was carried away from the earth, so as no longer to have any interests in common with men; but he declares, that he will go in a very different manner, so as to <em>draw </em>upwards to himself those who were fixed on the earth. Now, though he alludes to the form of his death, yet he means generally, that his death will not be a division to separate him from men, but that it will be an additional means of <em>drawing </em>earth upwards towards heaven. </p><p><em>I will draw all men to myself. </em>The word <em>all, </em>which he employs, must be understood to refer to the children of God, who belong to his flock. Yet I agree with Chrysostom, who says that Christ used the universal term, <em>all</em>, because the Church was to be gathered equally from among Gentiles and Jews, according to that saying, </p><p>There shall be one shepherd, and one sheepfold, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_10:16</span>.) </p><p>The old Latin translation has, <em>I will draw </em>all things <em>to me</em>; and Augustine maintains that we ought to read it in that manner; but the agreement of all the Greek manuscripts ought to have greater weight with us. </p></div>
