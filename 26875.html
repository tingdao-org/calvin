<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And he saw and believed. </em>It is a poor exposition which some give of these words, that John <em>believed </em>what he had heard Mary say, namely, that Christ’s body had been carried away; for there is no passage in which the word <em>believe </em>bears this meaning, especially when it is used simply and without any addition. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that <em>Peter and John </em>return home, while they are still in doubt and perplexity; for in some passages John had employed this phraseology, when lie intended to describe the increase of faith. Besides, <span class="bvs">Luk_24:12</span> relates that <em>Peter wondered </em>at seeing the sepulcher in such good order; meaning by this, that Peter thought of something greater and loftier than what Mary had told him. </p></div>
