<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">提玛地的居民拿水来，送给口渴的，拿饼来迎接逃避的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>To meet the thirsty bring waters. </em><span class="cite-ref">(72)</span> He heightens the description of that trembling with which the Lord had determined to strike the Arabians in such a manner that they thought of nothing but flight, and did not take time even to collect those things which were necessary for the journey. Isaiah therefore declares that the Arabians will come into the country of Dedanim, empty and destitute of all things, and that they will not be provided with any food. On this account he exhorts the inhabitants to go out and meet them with bread and water, because otherwise they will faint through the want of the necessaries of life. </p><p>I am aware that this passage is explained differently by some commentators, who think that the Prophet mocks at the Arabians, who had been cruel and barbarous towards the Jews; as if he had said, “How gladly you would now bring water to the thirsty!” But that exposition is too constrained. And yet I do not deny that they received the reward of their cruelty, when they ran hither and thither in a state of hunger. But the meaning which I have given is twofold, <span class="cite-ref">(73)</span> that the Arabians in their flight will be so wretched that they will not even have the necessary supply of water, and they will therefore faint with thirst, if they do not quickly receive assistance; and he intimates that there will be a scarcity both of food and of drink. He calls on the neighbors to render assistance; not to exhort them to do their duty, but to state the fact more clearly; and he enjoins them to give their bread to them, not because it is deserved, but because they are suffering extreme want. Yet as it is founded on the common law of nature and humanity, the Prophet indirectly insinuates that the hungry and thirsty are defrauded of their bread, when food is denied to them. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(72)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(73)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
