<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们彼此商量说，来吧，我们要作砖，把砖烧透了。他们就拿砖当石头，又拿石漆当灰泥。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And they said one to another </em><span class="cite-ref">(324)</span> That is, they mutually exhorted each other; and not only did every man earnestly put his own hand to the work, but impelled others also to the daring attempt. </p><p><em>Let us make brick</em>. Moses intimates that they had not been induced to commence this work, on account of the ease with which it could be accomplished nor on account of any other advantages which presented themselves; he rather shows that they had contended with great and arduous difficulties; by which means their guilt became the more aggravated. For how is it that they harass and wear themselves out in vain on a difficult and labourious enterprise, unless that, like madmen, they rush impetuously against God? Difficulty often deters us from necessary works; but these men, when they had neither stones nor mortar, yet do not scruple to attempt the raising of an edifice which may transcend the clouds. We are taught therefore, by this example, to what length the lust of men will hurry them, when they indulge their ambition. Even a profane poet is not silent on this subject, — </p><p><em>“Man, rashly daring, full of pride, </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Most covets what is most denied.” </em><span class="cite-ref">(325)</span><em><LineBreak /></em><em>And a little afterwards, </em>— <em><LineBreak /></em><em>“Counts nothing arduous, and tries </em><em><LineBreak /></em><em>Insanely to possess the skies.” </em><span class="cite-ref">(326)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(324)</span><span class="cite-ref">“</span>Dixit vir ad proximum suum,” as it is in the margin of the English version. “A man said to his neighbor.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(325)</span></p><p>“Audax omnia perpeti <LineBreak />Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas.” <LineBreak />Hor. Lib. 1 Ode 3. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(326)</span></p><p>“Nil mortalibus arduum est <LineBreak />Coelum ipsum petimus stultitia.” <LineBreak />Ibid. </p></div></div>
