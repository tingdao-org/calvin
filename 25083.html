<div class="CUV verse">报告神悦纳人的禧年。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>To preach the acceptable year of the Lord </em>Many think that here the prophet makes an allusion to the Jubilee, and I have no objection to that view. But it is proper to observe, that he purposely anticipates a doubt, which might disturb and shake weak minds, while the Lord held them in suspense, by delaying so long the promised salvation. He therefore makes the time of redemption to depend on the purpose, or good pleasure, of God. “In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.” Paul calls it <em>the fullness of the time, </em>(<span class="bvs">Gal_4:4</span>,) that believers may learn not to indulge in excessive curiosity, but to acquiesce in the will of God, — and that we may rest satisfied with the conviction, that salvation was manifested in Christ, at the time which seemed good in the sight of God. </p></div>
