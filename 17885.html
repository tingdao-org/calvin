<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">稠密的树林，他要用铁器砍下，利巴嫩的树木必被大能者伐倒。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>And he will cut down the thick places of the forest with iron. </em>There is no difficulty in explaining this metaphor, for it is plain enough that by tall and high trees is denoted all that is powerful, excellent, or lofty. Thus he foretells the destruction and ruin of Judea, which he compares to the <em>cutting down of a forest</em>; by which he means that there is nothing so valuable that the enemies will not destroy it, till they have stripped the whole land of its ornaments. </p><p><em>And Lebanon will fall violently. </em>He mentions <em>Lebanon</em>, because that mountain, as we all know, was highly celebrated for fruitful and highly valuable trees. Now, if he had been speaking of the Assyrians, it would not have been appropriate to introduce the destruction of <em>Lebanon</em>. Hence we infer that the Prophet, in this passage, again threatens the Jews; and this agrees well with the introduction of the discourse, for it begins with a word which calls attention, <em>Behold. </em></p></div>
