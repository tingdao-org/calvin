<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>It is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. </em>The reply of Christ is most appropriate. There is no other way, in which we have a right to expect the assistance promised in that passage, than when believers humbly submit themselves to his guidance: for we cannot rely on his promises, without obeying his commandments. God is <em>tempted </em>in many ways: but in this passage, the word <em>tempt </em>denotes the neglect of those means which he puts into our hands. Those who leave the means which God recommends, and resolve to make trial of his power and might, act as absurdly as if one were to cut off a man’s arms and hands, and then order him to work. In short, whoever desires to make an experiment of the divine power, when there is no necessity for it, <em>tempts God </em>by subjecting his promises to an unfair trial. </p></div>
