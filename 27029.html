<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>In what power </em>They do yet seem to have some zeal of God. For they feign that they are careful that the honor due unto God may not be given to any other. <em>Name </em>is taken in this place for authority. In sum, they deal as if they were most earnest defenders and maintainers of God’s glory. In the mean season, their importunateness is wonderful, in that they go about to drive the apostles to make denial, by asking many questions concerning a manifest matter, and to wring out by fear some other thing than they had confessed. But God doth bring their crafty wiliness to nought, and maketh them hear that which they would not. </p></div>
