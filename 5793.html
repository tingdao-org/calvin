<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这不都是积蓄在我这里，封锁在我府库中吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>Is not this laid up in store with me? </em>Although some explain this verse as relating to their punishments, as if God asserted that various kinds of them were laid up with Him, which He could produce whenever He pleased, it is more correct to understand it of their crimes. We are well aware that the ungodly, when God stays His severity, promise themselves impunity, as if His forbearance were a kind of connivance. Unless, therefore, He straightway lifts up His hand to chastise them, they imagine that all recollection of their crimes has vanished from before Him; and consequently the prophets often remind hypocrites of the day of visitation, in order that they may not suppose that they have gained anything by the delay. For this reason Jeremiah says that </p><p>“the sin of Judah is written with an iron pen<LineBreak />and with the point of a diamond,” (<span class="bvs">Jer_17:1</span>.) </p><p>Moses employs a different figure, that, although God may not appear as an immediate avenger, still their sins are stored up in his treasures, and will be brought to light by Him at the fitting season. Hence we gather the profitable lesson, that although God may make as though He saw not <em>(dissimulet) </em>for a time, still He does not forget the iniquities, the memory of which wretched men foolishly imagine to be blotted out, unless they are pursued by God’s immediate vengeance. </p></div>
