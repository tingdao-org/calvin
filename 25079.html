<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_4:15</span><strong>.</strong><em>He was glorified by all. </em>This is stated by Luke for the express purpose of informing us, that, from the very commencement, a divine power shone in Christ, and compelled even those, who cherished a malignant spirit of contradiction, to join in admiring him. </p></div>
