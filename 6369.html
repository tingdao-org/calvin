<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但人的地界越过原得的地界。因为但人上去攻取利善，用刀击杀城中的人，得了那城，住在其中，以他们先祖但的名将利善改名为但。</div></div>
