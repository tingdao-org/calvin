<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And, when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it</em>. When he sees the people so infuriated, that he despairs of being able to resist their conspiracy, in perfidious cowardice he gives way to compliance. And this end awaits all those who do not dare ingenuously and firmly to maintain what is right, but who bargain, as it were, and descend to compromises; for, after they have vacillated for a while, <span class="cite-ref">(332)</span> they at length succumb altogether, so as to shrink from nothing, however unworthy and disgraceful. He seems, indeed, by his proclamation to uplift their minds to the worship of the true God; but, when he is violating the law just given, it is a wretched quibble to shield their offensive and degenerate worship under God’s sacred name. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(332)</span> Addition in <em>Fr</em>. , “Et nage entre deux eaux;” and swam between two waters. </p></div></div>
