<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">雅各说，我的儿子不可与你们一同下去。他哥哥死了，只剩下他，他若在你们所行的路上遭害，那便是你们使我白发苍苍，悲悲惨惨地下阴间去了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>My son shall not go down with you</em>. Again we see, as in a lively picture, with what sorrow holy Jacob had been oppressed. He sees his whole family famishing: he would rather be torn away from life than from his son: whence we gather that he was not iron-hearted: but his patience is the more deserving of praise, because he contended with the infirmity of the flesh, and did not sink under it. And although Moses does not give a rhetorical amplification to his language, we nevertheless easily perceive that he was overcome with excessive grief, when he thus complained to his sons, You are too cruel to your father, in taking away from me a third son, after I have been plundered of first one and then another. </p></div>
