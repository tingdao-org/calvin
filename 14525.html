<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>Hear my prayer, O Jehovah! </em>David gradually increases his vehemence in prayer. He speaks first of <em>prayer; </em>in the second place, of <em>crying; </em>and in the third place, of <em>tears </em>This gradation is not a mere figure of rhetoric, which serves only to adorn the style, or to express the same thing in different language. This shows that David bewailed his condition sincerely, and from the bottom of his heart; and in this he has given us, by his own example, a rule for prayer. When he calls himself a <em>stranger </em>and a <em>sojourner, </em>he again shows how miserable his condition was; and he adds expressly, <em>before God, </em>not only because men are absent from God so long as they dwell in this world, but in the same sense in which he formerly said, <em>My days are before thee as nothing; </em>that is to say, God, without standing in need of any one to inform him, knows well enough that men have only a short journey to perform in this world, the end of which is soon reached, or that they remain only a short time in it, as those who are lodged in a house for pay. <span class="cite-ref">(78)</span> The purport of the Psalmist’s discourse is, that God sees from heaven how miserable our condition would be, if he did not sustain us by his mercy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(78)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme des gens qui sont logez en une maison par emprunt</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
