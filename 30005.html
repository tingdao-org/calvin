<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And I said, etc. </em>This was God’s sentence, by which he declared that they were destitute of a sound mind, and he adds the reason, <em>For they have not known my ways. </em>In short, he regarded them as past hope, for they were without sense and reason. And here he assumed the character of man, who at length after long trials declares that he has discovered obstinate madness, for he says that they always went astray, and no hope of repentance appeared. </p></div>
