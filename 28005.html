<div class="CUV verse">满口是咒骂苦毒。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong>Then he says, that <em>their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness </em><span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> — a vice of an opposite character to the former; but the meaning is, that they are in every way full of wickedness; for if they speak fair, they deceive and blend poison with their flatteries; but if they draw forth what they have in their hearts, bitterness and cursing stream out. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span><span class="bvs">Psa_10:7</span>. Paul corrects the order of the words as found in the <em>Septuagint, </em>and gives the Hebrew more exactly, but retains the word “bitterness,” by which the <em>Septuagint </em>have rendered <span class="lang he-il">מרמות</span>, which means <em>deceit, </em>or rather, mischievous deceit. Some think that it ought to be <span class="lang he-il">מררות</span>, “bitterness;” but there is no copy in its favor. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
