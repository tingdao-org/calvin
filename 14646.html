<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Mount Zion shall rejoice </em>The Psalmist now concludes his exhortation to rejoicing, telling us that Jerusalem and the other cities of Judea shall have cause to commend the righteousness of God, <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> because they had found from undoubted experience that he was the protector of their welfare. He here makes use of the word <em>judgment, </em>because God, who undertook the cause of his Church, openly showed that he was the enemy of her oppressors, and that he would repress their presumption and audacity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Auront matiere de liesse</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. “Shall have matter of gladness.” </p></div></div>
