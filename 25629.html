<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">主人就夸奖这不义的管家作事聪明。因为今世之子，在世事之上，较比光明之子，更加聪明。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And the master commended the unjust steward </em>Here it is obvious that if we were to attempt to find a meaning for every minute circumstance, we would act absurdly. To make donations out of what belongs to another man, is an action which is very far from deserving applause; and who would patiently endure that an unprincipled villain should rob him of his property, and give it away according to his own fancy? It were indeed the grossest stupidity, if that man who beheld a portion of his substance taken away, should <em>commend </em>the person who stole the remainder of it and bestowed it on others. But Christ only meant what he adds a little afterwards, that ungodly and worldly men are more industrious and skillful in conducting the affairs of this fading life, than the children of God are anxious to obtain the heavenly and eternal life, or careful to make it the subject of their study and meditation. </p><p>By this comparison he charges us with highly criminal indifference, in not providing for the future, with at least as much earnestness as ungodly men display by attending to their own interests in this world. How disgraceful is it that <em>the children of light, </em>whom God enlightens by his Spirit and word, should slumber and neglect the hope of eternal blessedness held out to them, while worldly men are so eagerly bent on their own accommodations, and so provident and sagacious! Hence we infer, that our Lord does not intend to compare the wisdom of the Spirit to the wisdom of the flesh, (which could not have been done without pouring contempt on God himself,) but only to arouse believers to consider more attentively what belongs to the future life, and not to shut their eyes against the light of the Gospel, when they perceive that even the blind, amidst their darkness, see more clearly. And, indeed, <em>the children of light </em>ought to be more powerfully excited, when they behold <em>the children of this world </em>making provision against a distant period, for a life which is fading, and which passes in a moment. </p></div>
