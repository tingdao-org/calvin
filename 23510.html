<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">压伤的芦苇，他不折断。将残的灯火，他不吹灭。等他施行公理，叫公理得胜。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Till he send out judgment into victory. </em>The words of the prophet are a little different, <em>he will bring forth the judgment unto truth. </em>But the term employed by Matthew is very emphatic, and is intended to inform us, that <em>justice </em>is not established in the world without a great struggle and exertion. The devil throws all possible difficulties in the way, which cannot be removed without violent opposition. This is confirmed by the word <em>victory, </em>for victory is not obtained in any other way than by fighting. </p></div>
