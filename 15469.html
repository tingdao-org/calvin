<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在列邦中述说他的荣耀，在万民中述说他的奇事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>Declare his glory among the heathen </em>Additional terms are adduced to commend the salvation spoken of. It is called <em>his glory </em>and <em>his wonders; </em>which is equivalent to saying that it was glorious and admirable. By such titles the Psalmist would distinguish it from any deliverances which had formerly been granted, as indeed there can be but one opinion, that when God appeared as Redeemer of all the world, he gave a display of his mercy and of his favor, such as he never vouchsafed before. This salvation it was impossible, as I have said, that the Gentile nations could have celebrated, had they been left without it. The words teach us that we can never be said to have rightly apprehended the redemption wrought out by Christ, unless our minds have been raised to the discovery of something incomparably wonderful about it. </p></div>
