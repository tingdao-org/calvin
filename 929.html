<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">拉班清早起来，与他外孙和女儿亲嘴，给他们祝福，回往自己的地方去了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>55.</strong><em>And blessed them</em>. The character of the person is here to be noticed, because Laban, who had lapsed from true piety, and was a man of unholy and wicked manners, yet retained the habit of giving his blessing. For we are hereby taught, that certain principles of divine knowledge remain in the hearts of the wicked, so that no excuse may be left to them on the ground of ignorance; for the custom of pronouncing a blessing arises hence, that men are certainly persuaded that God alone is the author of all good things. For although they may proudly arrogate what they please to themselves; yet when they return to their right mind, they are compelled, whether they will or no, to acknowledge that all good proceeds from God alone. </p></div>
