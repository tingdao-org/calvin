<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_1:27</span><em>What new doctrine is this? </em>They call it <em>new </em>doctrine, not by way of reproach, but as an acknowledgment, that there was something in it unusual and extraordinary. It is not for the sake of blame, or to lessen its credit, that they speak of it as <em>new. </em>This is rather a part of their admiration, that they pronounce it to be not common or ordinary. Their only fault lies in this, that they remain in their state of hesitation, <span class="cite-ref">(346)</span> whereas the children of God ought to make increasing progress. </p><p><strong>(346)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En leur doute et estonnement</span>.” — “In their doubt and astonishment.” </p></div>
