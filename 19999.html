<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶利米向众百姓说完了耶和华他们神的一切话，就是耶和华他们神差遣他去所说的一切话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet proceeds with the remaining part of the narrative. He says that the <em>whole people </em>obstinately persevered in their wicked design, so that he effected nothing by his warning and protest. Now this stupidity of the people was monstrous; for they had found out by experience the fidelity of the Prophet for many years; and further, they had gone to him because they believed that he was a faithful and an approved servant of God. He had not merely answered them in God’s name, but as he knew their hardness, he added protestations which might have moved even stones. But he addressed the deaf; and it hence appears that they were wholly fascinated by the devil. And thus let us learn not to mock God, nor bring a double heart when we inquire as to his will, but to suffer ourselves to be ruled by his word. </p></div>
