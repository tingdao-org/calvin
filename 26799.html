<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Who had given counsel to the Jews. </em>The Evangelist repeats the opinion of Caiaphas, which formerly came under our notice; <span class="cite-ref">(136)</span> for God employed the foul mouth of a wicked and treacherous <em>high priest </em>to utter a prediction, (<span class="bvs">Joh_11:50</span>,) just as he guided the tongue of the prophet Baham, contrary to his wish, so that he was constrained to bless the people, though he desired to curse them, to gain favor with king Balak, (<span class="bvs">Num_23:7</span>.) </p><p><strong>(136)</strong> Vol. 1: page 453. </p></div>
