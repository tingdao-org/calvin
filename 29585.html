<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>Who killed the Lord Jesus</em>. As that people had been distinguished by so many benefits from God, in consequence of the glory of the ancient fathers, the very name <span class="cite-ref">(544)</span> was of great authority among many. Lest this disguise should dazzle the eyes of any one, he strips the Jews of all honor, so as to leave them nothing but odium and the utmost infamy. </p><p>“Behold,” says he, “the virtues for which they deserve praise among the good and pious! — they killed their own prophets and at last the Son of God, they have persecuted me his servant, they wage war with God, they are detested by the whole world, they are hostile to the salvation of the Gentiles; in fine, they are destined to everlasting destruction.” </p><p>It is asked, why he says that Christ and the prophets were killed by the same persons? I answer, that this refers to the entire body, <span class="cite-ref">(545)</span> for Paul means that there is nothing new or unusual in their resisting God, but that, on the contrary, they are, in this manner, <em>filling up the measure of their fathers</em>, as Christ speaks. (<span class="bvs">Mat_23:32</span>) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(544)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De Juif</span>;” — “Of Jew.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(545)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A tout le corps du peuple</span>;” — “To the whole body of the people.” </p></div></div>
