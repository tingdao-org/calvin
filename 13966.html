<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">救恩属乎耶和华。愿你赐福给你的百姓。（细拉）</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Salvation belongeth unto the Lord. </em>Because <span class="lang he-il">ל</span> is sometimes used by the Hebrews for <span class="lang he-il">מך</span><em>Min, </em>some not improperly translate this clause, <em>Salvation is of the Lord. </em>I, however consider the natural and obvious meaning to be simply this, that salvation or deliverance is only in the hands of God. By these words, David not only claims the office and praise of saving for God alone, tacitly opposing his power to all human succor; but also declares, that although a thousand deaths hang over his people, yet this cannot render God unable to save them, or prevent him from speedily sending forth without any effort, the deliverance which he is always able to impart. In the end of the psalm, David affirms that this was vouchsafed, not so much to him as an individual, as to the whole people, that the universal Church, whose welfare depended on the safety and prosperity of his kingdom, might be preserved from destruction. David, therefore, acknowledges the dispersion of this wicked conspiracy to have been owing to the care which God had about the safety of his Church. From this passage we learn, that the Church shall always be delivered from the calamities which befall her, because God who is able to save her, will never withdraw his grace and blessing from her. </p></div>
