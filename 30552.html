<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他为我们的罪作了挽回祭。不是单为我们的罪，也是为普天下人的罪。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>And not for ours only </em>He added this for the sake of amplifying, in order that the faithful might be assured that the expiation made by Christ, extends to all who by faith embrace the gospel. </p><p>Here a question may be raised, how have the sins of the whole world been expiated? I pass by the dotages of the fanatics, who under this pretense extend salvation to all the reprobate, and therefore to Satan himself. Such a monstrous thing deserves no refutation. They who seek to avoid this absurdity, have said that Christ <span class="cite-ref">(63)</span> suffered sufficiently for the whole world, but efficiently only for the elect. This solution has commonly prevailed in the schools. Though then I allow that what has been said is true, yet I deny that it is suitable to this passage; for the design of John was no other than to make this benefit common to the whole Church. Then under the word <em>all </em>or whole, he does not include the reprobate, but designates those who should believe as well as those who were then scattered through various parts of the world. For then is really made evident, as it is meet, the grace of Christ, when it is declared to be the only true salvation of the world. </p><p><strong>(63)</strong> “It seems to me that the Apostle is to be understood as speaking only of all those who believe, whether Jews or Gentiles, over the whole world.” — <em>Doddridge</em>. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
