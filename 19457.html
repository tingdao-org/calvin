<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">说，坐大卫宝座的犹大王阿，你和你的臣仆，并进入城门的百姓，都当听耶和华的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>But he speaks of the king as <em>sitting on the throne of David; </em>but not, as I have already said, for the sake of honor, but for the purpose of enhancing his guilt; for he occupied a sacred throne, of which he was wholly unworthy. For though God is said to sit in the midst of the gods, because by him kings rule, we yet know that the throne of David was more eminent than any other; for it was a priestly kingdom and a type of that celestial kingdom which was afterwards fully revealed in Christ. As, then, the kings of Judah, the descendants of David, were types of Christ, less tolerable was their impiety, when, unmindful of their vocation, they had departed from the piety of their father David and became wholly degenerated. So the Prophet, by mentioning the house of Israel and the house of Jacob, no doubt condemned the Jews, because they had become unlike the holy patriarch. We now, then, understand the object of the Prophet when he says, “Hear the word of Jehovah, thou king of Judah, who <em>sittest on the throne of David.” </em></p><p>But that his reproof might have its just weight, the Prophet carefully shews that he brought nothing but what had been committed to him from above; this is the reason why he repeats, <em>thou shalt say, </em>“Thus saith Jehovah, Go down, speak, and say.” From the king he comes to the courtiers, and from them to the whole people. <em>Thou, </em>he says, <em>and thy servants; </em>by the king’s servants the Scripture means, all those ministers who were his counsellors, who were appointed to administer justice and who exercised authority. But we must notice, that at last he addresses the whole people. We hence see that what he taught belonged in common to all, though he began with the king and his counsellors, that the common people might not think that they would be unpunished if they despised the doctrine to which even kings were to submit. </p></div>
