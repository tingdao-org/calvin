<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>This was done thrice. </em>The repetition of the vision served for the confirmation of Peter, lest any doubt <span class="cite-ref">(672)</span> should remain in his mind. Whence we gather how deeply the observing of the law was rooted in his mind. And I know no reason why God left him in a dump, [perplexed,] until, by the event which followed, he might learn the cause of the vision, save only because being astonished he did not desire to know what this thing meant; although it was all in good time, that the messengers of Cornelius should come shortly after to interpret it. The <em>vessel </em>was at length taken up again into heaven, that Peter might be certified that this message came from heaven, [God.] </p><p><strong>(672)</strong> “Vel anxietas vel scrupulus,” or anxiety or scruple, omitted. </p></div>
