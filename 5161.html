<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你今日当知道，耶和华你的神在你前面过去，如同烈火，要灭绝他们，将他们制伏在你面前。这样，你就要照耶和华所说的赶出他们，使他们速速灭亡。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Understand therefore this day. </em>He concludes from what has preceded that the Israelites would be too perverse, unless they acknowledge that their enemies were overcome by the hand of God; and, still more to heighten the miracle, he uses a similitude, comparing God to a fire, which consumes so many nations in an unwonted and incredible manner. It is as if he had said, that it could not be effected by human or ordinary means that so many and such warlike peoples could thus quickly perish. Elsewhere God is called “a consuming fire” in a different sense, that we may fear his wrath and power; but here Moses only means that the destruction of the Canaanitish nations was His wonderful work. </p></div>
