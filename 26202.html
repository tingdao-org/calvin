<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">到了加利利，加利利人既然看见他在耶路撒冷过节所行的一切事，就接待他。因为他们也是上去过节。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>The Galileans received him. </em>Whether or not this honor was of long duration we have not the means of determining; for there is nothing to which men are more prone than forgetfulness of the gifts of God. Nor does John relate this with any other design than to inform us that Christ performed miracles in presence of many witnesses, so that the report of them was spread far and wide. Again, this points out one advantage of miracles, that they prepare the way for doctrine; for they cause reverence to be paid to Christ. </p></div>
