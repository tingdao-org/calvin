<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀，你们也就是我的门徒了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>In this my Father is glorified </em>This is a confirmation of the former statement; for he shows that we ought not to doubt that God will listen to the prayers of his people, when they desire to be rendered fruitful; for this contributes very greatly to his glory. But by this end or effect he likewise kindles in them the desire of doing good; for there is nothing which we ought to value more highly than that the name of God may be glorified by us. To the same effect is the latter clause, <em>that you may become my disciples; </em>for he declares that he has no one in his flock who does not <em>bear fruit </em>to the <em>glory </em>of God. </p></div>
