<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">是借着他给我们开了一条又新又活的路从幔子经过，这幔子就是他的身体。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Through the veil, etc. </em>As the veil covered the recesses of the sanctuary and yet afforded entrance there, so the divinity, though hid in the flesh of Christ, yet leads us even into heaven; nor can any one find God except he to whom the man Christ becomes the door and the way. Thus we are reminded, that Christ’s glory is not to be estimated according to the external appearance of his flesh; nor is his flesh to be despised, because it conceals as a veil the majesty of God, while it is also that which conducts us to the enjoyment of all the good things of God. </p></div>
