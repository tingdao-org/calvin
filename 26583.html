<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">马利亚就拿着一斤极贵的真哪哒香膏，抹耶稣的脚，又用自己头发去擦。屋里就满了膏的香气。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And the house was filled with the odor </em>of the ointment. It was not a simple liquor extracted from <em>spikenard, </em>but a compound of many odoriferous substances; and therefore it is not wonderful that <em>the </em>whole <em>house was filled with the odor </em></p></div>
