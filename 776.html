<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Arise, go to Padan-aram</em>. In the first place, he commands him to take a wife from his maternal race. He might have sent for her by some one of his servants, as Rebekah had been brought to him; but perhaps he took this course to avoid the envy of Esau, who might regard it as a reproach if more solicitude were manifested about his brother’s marriage than about his own. </p></div>
