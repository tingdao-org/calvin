<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他说，阿摩司阿，你看见什么。我说，看见一筐夏天的果子。耶和华说，我民以色列的结局到了。我必不再宽恕他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now follows the exposition of the vision, <em>Jehovah said to me, Come has the end on my people Israel </em>We perceive, then, the meaning of the Prophet to be, — that the people had hitherto been warned by moderate punishments; but that as they had become hardened, extreme vengeance was nigh at hand, when God would no longer perform the part of a father or of a physician, but would utterly destroy those whom he had long borne with. We indeed know that most grievous calamities had happened to the people of Israel, even before this time; but whenever God showed forbearance, he ever allured them to true penitence. Lest, then, they should promise such a treatment to themselves hereafter, and by self flatteries protract time, as hypocrites are wont to do, the Prophet declares here expressly, that the end had come; as though he said, “Your iniquity is ripe: now then gather the fruit; for ye cannot proceed farther, no, not even for one day. Fruit will indeed come to you of itself.” <em>The end then is come, and I will no more add to pass by them. </em>To pass by, as we have already explained, is to be referred to punishment. For why does God chastise his people, except that he is solicitous for their salvation? He says, then, that he would make an end, that he would not spend labor hereafter in correcting the people, for he saw that nothing availed. Hence, <em>I will not pass by them, </em>that is, I will execute my extreme vengeance: <em class="lang fr-fr">Il n’y faudra plus retourner </em><em>, </em>as we commonly say. It follows — </p></div>
