<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">至于我，我要住在米斯巴，伺候那到我们这里来的迦勒底人。只是你们当积蓄酒，油，和夏天的果子，收在器皿里，住在你们所占的城邑中。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>And he ordered them to <em>gather </em>wine, and corn, and fruit, and to store them up, as there would be no danger from war. He also ordered them to dwell in the <em>cities </em>which they had taken, or to which they had been driven. The verb here is ambiguous; but I prefer its most literal meaning, <em>which ye have taken. </em>They could not, indeed, have taken a city by force and arms, as they had only a few men, and could never have been equal to their enemies. Then the forcible taking of cities is not what is meant; but Gedaliah’s meaning was, that they might safely remain wherever they were, or that they might dwell in any city they came to. But it was a great ‘thing when he said to them, that he would <em>stand </em>for them; for he thus laid down his own life, as though he had said that he would be a surety that nothing grievous should happen to them. And hence it is more clearly seen that he did not regard himself, but that he used the power given him for the public good; for if he had ambition, he would have been, doubtless, more careful to ingratiate himself with the king of Babylon, and he would have resolved to deal no less cruelly with a people so hard and refractory, than their enemies. But when he extended his wings as the hen, to gather under them the residue of his own nation, it appears quite evident that he had no care for his own private safety, but that whatever power had been given him by King Nebuchadnezzar, he employed it wholly for the public good. </p><p>Then these words ought to be especially noticed, And <em>I, behold, I will dwell in Mizpah, that I may stand, </em>etc., that is, that I may meet the Chaldeans <em>who may come to us, </em>that is, lest they should come upon you for some hostile purpose. It afterwards follows — </p></div>
