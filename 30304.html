<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">原来那说不可奸淫的，也说不可杀人。你就是不奸淫，却杀人，仍是成了犯律法的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>For he that said</em>, or <em>he who hath said</em>. This is a proof of the former verse; because the Lawgiver is to be considered rather than each particular precept apart. The righteousness of God, as an indivisible body, is contained in the law. Whosoever, then, transgresses one article of the Law, destroys, as far as he can, the righteousness of God. Besides, as in one part, so in every part, God’s will is to try our obedience. Hence a transgressor of the law is every one who offends as to any one of its commandments according to this saying, </p><p>“Cursed is he who fulfills not all things.”<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_27:26</span>.) </p><p>We further see, that the transgressor of the law, and the guilty of all, mean the same according to James. </p></div>
