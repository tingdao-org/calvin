<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">将所遇的一切事，详细说给他的妻细利斯，和他的众朋友听。他的智慧人，和他的妻细利斯对他说，你在末底改面前始而败落，他如果是犹大人，你必不能胜他，终必在他面前败落。</div></div>
