<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">是因耶稣曾吩咐污鬼从那人身上出来。原来这鬼屡次抓住他，他常被人看守，又被铁链和脚镣捆锁，他竟把锁链挣断，被鬼赶到旷野去。</div></div>
