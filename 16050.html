<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，你与我相近。你一切的命令尽都真实。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>151.</strong><em>Thou, O Jehovah! art near. </em>He encourages himself from the consolatory consideration, that God, when he sees his own people sore pressed, comes forward, seasonably to afford them succor; even as Paul on this subject says, </p><p>“Be not over-careful, the Lord is at hand, let your moderation be known to all men ”<em><LineBreak /></em>(<span class="bvs">Phi_4:5</span>) </p><p>The concluding sentence of the verse is to this effect, That God never forsakes nor disappoints his people in their necessity, because he is true to his promises; and in them he assures us, that the welfare of his people will always be the object of his care. That therefore we may be fully persuaded that the hand of God is always ready to repulse the assaults of our enemies, let us retain a settled belief of the truth, that he does not in vain promise in his word to be the guardian of our welfare. </p></div>
