<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">That no flesh should glory in his presence.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">使一切有血气的，在神面前一个也不能自夸。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>That no flesh should glory </em>Though the term <em>flesh </em>here, and in many passages of Scripture, denotes all mankind, yet in this passage it carries with it a particular idea; for the Spirit, by speaking of mankind in terms of contempt, beats down their pride, as in <span class="bvs">Isa_31:3</span> — <em>The Egyptian is flesh and not spirit </em>It is a sentiment that is worthy to be kept in remembrance — that there is nothing left us in which we may justly glory. With this view he adds the expression <em>in God’s presence </em>For <em>in the presence of the world </em>many delight themselves for the moment in a false glorying, which, however, quickly vanishes like smoke. At the same time, by this expression all mankind are put to silence when they come into the presence of God; as Habakkuk says — </p><p>Let all flesh keep silence before God, (<span class="bvs">Hab_2:20</span>.) </p><p>Let every thing, therefore, that is at all deserving of praise, be recognized as proceeding from God. </p></div>
