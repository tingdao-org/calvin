<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因此，以色列人在仇敌面前站立不住。他们在仇敌面前转背逃跑，是因成了被咒诅的。你们若不把当灭的物从你们中间除掉，我就不再与你们同在了。</div></div>
