<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们问巴录说，请你告诉我们，你怎样从他口中写这一切话呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The king’s counsellors were, no doubt, so astonished when they heard that these threatenings had been written as the Prophet had dictated them, that they were agitated by different thoughts, as the unbelieving are wont to be; and not receiving as they ought to have done, the heavenly doctrine, they vacillated, and could not pursue a uniform course. Such, then, was the uncertainty that possessed the minds of the princes; for they could hardly believe that these words had been delivered by memory, but had suspicion of some trickery, as the unbelieving imagine many such things respecting God’s servants; and they seem to act thus designedly, that they may obscure God’s favor, which appears before their eyes. For this purpose, then, they are said to <em>ask Baruch </em>how he took the <em>words from the mouth of Jeremiah </em><span class="cite-ref">(105)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(105)</span> Some have made two questions here, — “How didst thou write all these words? from his mouth?” The answer seems to favor this construction; as usual in Scripture, the last question is answered first, and then the first: Baruch said, “From his mouth he pronounced to me all these words;” and then he adds, answering the first question, “and I wrote on the book with ink.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
