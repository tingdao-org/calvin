<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你只要谨慎，殷勤保守你的心灵，免得忘记你亲眼所看见的事，又免得你一生，这事离开你的心。总要传给你的子子孙孙。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Only take heed to thyself </em>The same particle, <span class="lang he-il">רק</span>, <em>rak, </em>of which I have just spoken, is used here, and its meaning in this place is, as if Moses had said, that this <em>only </em>remained; unless it is preferred to translate it <em>nevertheless. </em>What follows means literally “Guard <em>(custodi) </em>thyself, and guard thy soul;” wherein Moses advances by degrees, reminding them that they needed no common heedfulness, but that they must beware with extreme vigilance and diligence lest they should fail through the want of them; for the slothfulness of the flesh must be spurred on by such instigations as these, and at the same time our weakness must be fortified, and we must take measures against our unsteadfastness; for nothing is more easy than that all our zeal should suddenly be forgotten, or should gradually grow cold. God had established the certainty of His law, as far as was necessary, for the grateful and attentive, yet not without reason does He desire the people to remember how great is the carelessness of men. Nor does he command those only to remember who were eye-witnesses, but also to hand down (what they had seen) to their sons and grandsons, that the memory of such remarkable things might be preserved. </p></div>
