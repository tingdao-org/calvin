<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们与你们列祖，君王，首领，并国内的百姓，在犹大城邑中和耶路撒冷街市上所烧的香，耶和华岂不记念，心中岂不思想吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>The incense, </em>he says, <em>which ye have burnt in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the whole people of the land, has not Jehovah remembered them? </em>Whence, he says, has this dreadful calamity proceeded, which has destroyed all your race? Even from the wrath of God, for it has not happened to you by chance, for God had by his servants predicted what afterwards has been really fulfilled. It then follows, that your city has been destroyed through the righteous judgment of God. And what has been the cause of so great and so grievous a vengeance? Even your incense. </p></div>
