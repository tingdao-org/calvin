<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，求你使我们得见你的慈爱，又将你的救恩赐给我们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Show us thy mercy, O Jehovah! </em>In these words there is the same contrast as in the preceding sentence. In supplicating that mercy may be extended to them, and deliverance granted them, they confess that they are deprived of all sense of both these blessings. Such having been the state of the saints in old time, let us learn, even when we are so oppressed with calamities as to be reduced to extremity, and on the brink of despair, to betake ourselves notwithstanding to God. <em>Mercy </em>is appropriately put in the first place; and then there is added <em>salvation, </em>which is the work and fruit of mercy; for no other reason can be assigned why God is induced to show himself our Savior, but that he is merciful. Whence it follows, that all who urge their own merits before Him as a plea for obtaining his favor, are shutting up the way of salvation. </p></div>
