<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又要将乌陵和土明放在决断的胸牌里，亚伦进到耶和华面前的时候，要带在胸前，在耶和华面前常将以色列人的决断牌带在胸前。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>And thou shalt put in the breastplate. </em>From these words some infer that the <em>Urim </em>and <em>Thummim </em>were distinct from the whole work, which is before described; others think that they were the twelve stones, because no mention will be made of them when Moses relates that the whole was completed. But nothing is more probable, as I have already said, than that on the breastplate itself some representation was given of light in doctrine, and of entire uprightness of life; and therefore after Moses has called it “the breastplate of judgment,” he also speaks of it as “the judgment of the children of Israel;” by which expression he means a certain and defined system, or an absolutely perfect rule, to which the children of Israel ought to direct and conform themselves. </p></div>
