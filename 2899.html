<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>And the flesh that toucheth. </em>It was not indeed lawful to eat of any polluted flesh, but in the sacrifices there was a special reason for this, <em>i.e., </em>because the uncleanness involved sacrilege. On this account he commands it to be burnt, just like that which had not been consumed within the legitimate time; and the punishment is, <span class="cite-ref">(288)</span> that if any unclean person shall have touched the consecrated meat, he should be cut off from the people. The cruelty or immoderate severity of this has induced some to think that to be “cut off” is nothing more than to be cast out of the camp. But it is not wonderful that God should have thus severely dealt with those who knowingly and wilfully contaminated what was holy; for if any one had sinned in error, he was not to receive this sentence, but only he who had betrayed his open contempt of God by impious profanation of sacred things. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(288)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">La punition est raise bien grieve</span>;” the punishment awarded is very heavy. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
