<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这必朽坏的，总要变成不朽坏的。（变成原文作穿下同）这必死的，总要变成不死的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>53.</strong><em>For this corruptible must </em>Mark, how we shall live in the kingdom of God both in body and in soul, while at the same time <em>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God </em>— for they shall previously be delivered from corruption. Our nature then, as being now corruptible and mortal, is not admissible into the kingdom of God, but when it shall have put off corruption, and shall have been beautified with in-corruption, it will then make its way into it. This passage, too, distinctly proves, that we shall rise again in that same flesh that we now carry about with us, as the Apostle assigns a new quality to it which will serve as a garment. If he had said, <em>This corruptible must be renewed, </em>the error of those fanatics, who imagine that mankind will be furnished with new bodies, would not have been so plainly or forcibly overthrown. Now, however, when he declares that <em>this corruptible shall be invested with glory, </em>there is no room left for cavil. </p></div>
