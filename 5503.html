<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">私生子不可入耶和华的会。他的子孙，直到十代，也不可入耶和华的会。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>A bastard shall not enter</em>. All agree that by the word <span class="lang he-il">ממזר</span>, <em>mamzer</em>, a bastard is signified, who is born of an uncertain father; but they take it in different ways, For some extend it to all bastards who spring from fornication, whilst others imagine that it refers to those only whose origin is doubtful, and who are called <em>vulgo geniti</em>; viz, whose mothers, in their base and common prostitution of themselves, have brought it about by their gross licentiousness, that their children should be born from this monstrous medley, as it were. This second opinion I approve of most. But, by this symbol God would admonish the seed of Abraham how exalted was its dignity, as being separate from the polluted heathen. Meanwhile, He would not altogether exclude these unhappy persons from the hope of salvation, although, by no fault of their own, they were unable to give the name of their father; but He only humbled them by a temporal punishment, and desired that their example should be profitable to others. </p></div>
