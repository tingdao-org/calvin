<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若有处女已经许配丈夫，有人在城里遇见她，与她行淫，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed</em>. The severity of the punishment is now extended further, and a betrothed woman is counted as a wife; and this for a very good reason, because she has plighted her troth, and it is a token of abandoned incontinency for the mind of a woman to be so alienated from the man to whom she is betrothed, as to prostitute her virginity to another’s embraces. But since one who has been ravished is not criminal, a woman is absolved if she be forced in a field, because it is probable that she yielded unwillingly, inasmuch as she was far from assistance. Although, however, the terms are accommodated to the comprehension of a rude people, it was the intention of God to distinguish force from consent. Thus if a girl had been forced in a retired part of a building, from whence her cries could not be heard, God would undoubtedly have her acquitted, provided she could prove her innocence by satisfactory testimony and conjecture. </p></div>
