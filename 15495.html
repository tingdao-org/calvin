<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">全地都要向耶和华欢乐。要发起大声欢呼歌颂。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>Exult before Jehovah all the earth </em>Here he repeats the exhortation with which he had begun, and by addressing it to the nations at large, he indicates that when God should break down the middle wall of partition all would be gathered to the common faith, and one Church formed throughout the whole world. When he speaks of musical instruments the allusion is evidently to the practice of the Church at that time, without any intention of binding down the Gentiles to the observance of the ceremonies of the law. The repetition made use of is emphatical, and implies that the most ardent attempts men might make to celebrate the great work of the world’s redemption would fall short of the riches of the grace of God. This is brought out still more forcibly in what follows, where feeling is ascribed to things inanimate. The whole passage has been elsewhere expounded, and it is unnecessary to insist further upon it. </p></div>
