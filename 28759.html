<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">日有日的荣光，月有月的荣光，星有星的荣光。这星和那星的荣光，也有分别。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong><em>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon </em>Not only is there a difference between heavenly bodies and earthly, but even the heavenly bodies have not all the same glory; for the sun surpasses the moon, and the other stars differ from each other. This dissimilarity, accordingly, appears <span class="cite-ref">(103)</span> in the <em>resurrection </em>of the dead. A mistake, however, is commonly fallen into in the application; <span class="cite-ref">(104)</span> for it is supposed that Paul meant to say, that, after the resurrection, the saints will have different degrees of honor and glory. This, indeed, is perfectly true, and is proved by other declarations of Scripture; but it has nothing to do with Paul’s object. For he is not arguing as to what difference of condition there will be among the saints after the resurrection, but in what respect our bodies at present differ from those that we will one day receive. <span class="cite-ref">(105)</span></p><p>He removes, then, every idea of absurdity, by instituting this comparison: The substance of the sun and moon is the same, but there is a great difference between them in point of dignity and excellence. Is it to be wondered, then, if our body puts on a more excellent quality? <span class="cite-ref">(106)</span> “I do not teach that anything will take place at the resurrection but what is already presented before the eyes of all.” That such is the meaning of the words is clear from the context. For whence and for what purpose would Paul make such a transition, were he now comparing them with one another in respect of the difference of their condition, while up to this point he has been comparing the present condition of all with their future condition, and immediately proceeds with that comparison? </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(103)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ceste dinersite de qualite se monstre</span>;” — “This difference of quality shows itself.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(104)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En l’application de ceste similitude</span>;” — “In the application of this similitude.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(105)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comment different nos corps que nons auons maintenant de ceux que nons aurons apres</span>;” — “In what respect our bodies, which we have now, will differ from those that we shall have afterwards.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(106)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’il n’ha maintenant</span>;” — “Than it has now.” </p></div></div>
