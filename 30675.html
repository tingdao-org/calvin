<div class="CUV verse">愿怜恤，平安，慈爱，多多地加给你们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Mercy to you. </em>Mercy means nearly the same as grace in the salutations of Paul. Were any one to wish for a refined distinction, it may be said that grace is properly the effect of mercy; for there is no other reason why God has embraced us in love, but that he pitied our miseries. <em>Love </em>may be understood as that of God towards men, as well as that of men towards one another. <span class="cite-ref">(189)</span> If it be referred to God, the meaning is, that it might increase towards them, and that the assurance of divine love might be daily more confirmed in their hearts. The other meaning is, however, not unsuitable, that God would kindle and confirm in them mutual love. </p><p><strong>(189)</strong> As <em>mercy </em>is that of God, so it is more consistent to consider “peace” and “love’’ to be those of God: “may the mercy” of God, “and the peace” of God, “and the love” of God, “be increased (or multiplied) to you” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
