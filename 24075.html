<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">到了晚上，耶稣和十二个门徒坐席。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>When the evening was come, he sat down at table. </em>Not to eat <em>the passover, </em>which they were bound to do standing, as travelers, when they are in haste, are wont to take food hastily, </p><p>with shoes on their feet, and a staff in their hand,<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Exo_12:11</span>;) </p><p>but I consider the meaning to be, that after having observed the solemn rite, he <em>sat down at table </em>to supper. Accordingly, the Evangelists say, <em>when the evening was come: </em>for, at the commencement of the evening, they killed the lamb, and ate the flesh of it roasted. </p></div>
