<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_13:22</span><strong>.</strong><em>Journeying towards Jerusalem. </em>It is uncertain whether Luke speaks only of one journey, or means that, while Christ walked throughout Judea, and visited each part of it for the purpose of teaching, he was wont to <em>go up to Jerusalem </em>at the festivals. The former clause, certainly, appears to describe that course of life which Christ invariably pursued, from the time that he began to discharge the office which had been committed to him by the Father. To make the latter clause agree with this, the meaning will be, that, when the festivals were at hand, he attended, along with others, <span class="cite-ref">(226)</span> the holy assemblies. </p><p><strong>(226)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Sa coustume estoit de se trouver</span>;” — “his custom was to be present.” </p></div>
