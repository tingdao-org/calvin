<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们就彼此说，我们不要撕开，只要拈阄，看谁得着。这要应验经上的话说，他们分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。兵丁果然作了这事。</div></div>
