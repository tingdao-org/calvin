<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">全教会，和听见这事的人，都甚惧怕。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And there came fear. </em>He saith, again, that the punishment of one was a lesson to all. But he plainly expresseth in this place a double fear. He saith that the Church feared, because the faithful do never so perfectly fear God, but that they profit yet more, being admonished by his judgments. Therefore, by all those punishments which we read have been laid upon men in times past, and do daily see to be laid upon them, doth God call us back from the enticements and liberty of sinning. For our flesh must be bridled every now and then after this sort, because one bridle will scarce serve the turn. There was another manner [of] fear in the strangers, yet no such fear as brought them unto the sincere worship of God; yet, notwithstanding, it was such as caused them to give the glory to God. </p></div>
