<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为恶人的嘴，和诡诈人的口，已经张开攻击我。他们用撒谎的舌头对我说话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2</strong><em>Because the mouth of the wicked </em>David here very plainly declares, that he was the more solicitous to obtain help from God, in consequence of justice not being found among men. And though it is probable that he was rashly and furiously assailed, nevertheless, he complains that the mouth of deceit and fraud had been opened against him, and that he was surrounded with false tongues. Whence, to those who were ignorant of his real situation, there would appear to be some plausible pretext for his being loaded with reproaches, so much so indeed, that he would not be able to evade the charge of criminality. </p></div>
