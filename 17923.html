<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Their children shall be dashed in pieces. </em>He draws a picture of extreme cruelty. It is the utmost pitch of ferocity exercised by an invading army, when no age is spared, and infants, whose age makes it impossible for them to defend themselves, are slain. He represents it as still more shocking, when he adds, “<em>in the sight of </em>their parents.” To the same purpose is what follows about <em>plundering houses </em>and <em>ravishing wives</em>; for these things happen when the enemies have forgotten all humanity, and are inflamed to cruelty, and wish that those whom they have subdued, and even their very name, should be rooted out. </p></div>
