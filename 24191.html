<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>61.</strong><em>And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, were there. </em>Matthew and Mark relate only that <em>the women looked at what was done, and marked the place where the body was laid. </em>But Luke states, at the same time, their resolution, which was, that <em>they returned </em>to the city, <em>and prepared spices and ointments, </em>that two days afterwards they might render due honor to the burial. Hence we learn that their minds were filled with a better odor, which the Lord breathed into his death, that he might bring them to his grave, and exalt them higher. </p></div>
