<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">埃及的公侯要出来朝见神。古实人要急忙举手祷告。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Princes shall come out of Egypt. </em>He resumes the strain of thanksgiving, and confirms what he had previously asserted, that kings would come and pay tribute unto God. The examples which he brings forward are those of the Egyptians and Ethiopians. This sufficiently proves that the prediction must be extended to Christ, by whom the Egyptians and Ethiopians were brought under the sway of God. The word <span class="lang he-il">תריף</span>, <em>tarits, </em>translated, <em>shall soon stretch out, </em>might have been rendered, <em>shall cause to run. </em><span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> But it seemed necessary to soften the harshness of the figure. It is doubtful whether the allusion be to the promptness with which they should yield subjection, or whether he means that they would stretch out their hands to entreat pardon, this being an attitude common to suppliants. According to either interpretation, it is their submission which is intended, and it is enough to know that David asserts that Ethiopia and Egypt would come under the power of God, and not they only, but the most distant parts of the world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span> “The Hebrew is very emphatic: — ‘Cush will cause her hands to run out to God.’ She will with great <em>alacrity </em>and delight surrender her <em>power </em>and <em>influence </em>unto God.” — <em>Dr Adam Clarke</em>. </p></div></div>
