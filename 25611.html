<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">父亲却吩咐仆人说，把那上好的袍子快拿出来给他穿。把戒指戴在他指头上。把鞋穿在他脚上。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Bring out the best robe. </em>Although in parables (as we have frequently observed) it would be idle to follow out every minute circumstance, yet it will be no violence to the literal meaning, if we say, that our heavenly Father not only pardons our sins in such a manner as to bury the remembrance of them, but even restores those gifts of which we had been deprived; as, on the other hand, by taking them from us, he chastises our ingratitude in order to make us feel ashamed at the reproach and disgrace of our nakedness. </p></div>
