<div class="CUV verse">心利的诸王，以拦的诸王，玛代的诸王，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He now mentions nations more remote, but whose fame was more known among the Jews. We, indeed, know that the <em>Elamites, </em>who dwelt between Media and Persia, had ever been people of great repute. As to <em>Media, </em>it was a very large kingdom and wealthy, abounding in all delicacies; and we also know how fond of display were the Medes. With regard to <em>Zimri, </em><span class="cite-ref">(144)</span> it was an obscure nation in comparison with the Elamites and the Medes. The Prophet, however, intimates that every part of the earth, even the smallest kingdom, known to the Jews, would be visited by God’s judgment, so that the whole earth, in every direction, would become a witness that God sits in heaven as a judge. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(144)</strong> Blayney considers Zimri to be the same with Zimran, one of Abraham’s sons by Keturah, and he and his brethren were sent to “the east country.” (<span class="bvs">Gen_25:2</span>.) The Zameroeni, mentioned by Pliny as inhabiting some part of Arabia, were probably the descendants of Zimri. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
