<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你要爱耶和华你的神，常守他的吩咐，律例，典章，诫命。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God. </em>The whole address has this scope, that the people should testify their gratitude by their obedience, and thus being allured by God’s bounties, should reverently embrace His Law. On this account also, he requires them to love God, before he exhorts them to obey the Law itself. For, although he might have imperiously and menacingly commanded them, he preferred to lead them gently to obedience, by setting before them the sweetness of His grace. In sum, he exhorts them that, being invited by God’s love, they should love him in return. Meanwhile, it is well to observe that free affection is the foundation and beginning of duly obeying the Law, for what is drawn forth by constraint, or servile fear, cannot please God. He designates the precepts of the Law by various names, in order that they may zealously and attentively apply themselves to listen to God, who has omitted nothing calculated to regulate their life; for, by this variety of words, he signifies that God had familiarly and perfectly taught whatever was required. As to the three latter words, “his statutes, and judgments, and commandments,” what I have observed in Genesis and in the Psalms may be referred to. The word <span class="lang he-il">משמות</span>, <span class="cite-ref">(254)</span><em>meshamroth, </em>or guards, <em>(custodiae,) </em>which here stands first, is spoken in commendation of the Law on this ground, that it fences in our life, as it were, with rails, lest it should be exposed to errors on the right hand and on the left,. At the end of the verse he exhorts them to perseverance, because it was not allowable for the recollection of their deliverance ever to cease. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(254)</span><span class="lang he-il">משמרת</span><em>.
