<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?</div>
<div class="CUV verse">岂能在坟墓里述说你的慈爱吗？岂能在灭亡中述说你的信实吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>But to thee have I cried, O Jehovah! </em>There may have been a degree of intemperateness in the language of the prophet, which, as I have granted, cannot be altogether vindicated; but still it was a sign of rare faith and piety to persevere as he did with never-failing earnestness in prayer. This is what is meant when he says, that <em>he made haste in the morning; </em>by which he would have us not to imagine that he slowly and coldly lingered till he was constrained by dire necessity. At the same time, he modestly intimates by these words, that his pining away in long continued miseries was not owing to his own sluggishness, as if he had not sought God. This is an example particularly worthy of notice, that we may not become discouraged if it happen sometimes that our prayers are for a time unsuccessful, although they may proceed from the heart, and may be assiduously persevered in. </p></div>
