<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">遇见一颗重价的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了这颗珠子。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>And bought it. </em>By the word <em>buy </em>Christ does not mean, that men bring any price, with which they may purchase for themselves the heavenly life; for we know on what condition the Lord invites believers in the book of Isaiah, (<span class="bvs">Isa_55:1</span>,) <em>Come and buy wine and milk without money and without price. </em>But though the heavenly life, and every thing that belongs to it, is the free gift of God, yet we are said to <em>buy </em>it, when we cheerfully relinquish the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent us from obtaining it; as Paul says, that he </p><p>reckoned all things to be loss and dung, that he might gain Christ, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Phi_3:8</span>.) </p></div>
