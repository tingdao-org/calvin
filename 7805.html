<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王就吩咐左右的侍卫说，你们去杀耶和华的祭司。因为他们帮助大卫，又知道大卫逃跑，竟没有告诉我。扫罗的臣子却不肯伸手杀耶和华的祭司。</div></div>
