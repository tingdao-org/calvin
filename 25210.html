<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Young man, I say to thee. </em>By this word Christ proved the truth of the saying of Paul, that <em>God calleth those things which are not, as they were, </em>(<span class="bvs">Rom_4:17</span>.) He addresses the dead man, and makes himself be heard, so that death is suddenly changed into life. We have here, in the first place, a striking emblem of the future resurrection, as Ezekiel is commanded to say, <em>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord, </em>[<span class="bvs">Eze_37:4</span>.] Secondly, we are taught in what manner Christ quickens us spiritually by faith. It is when he infuses into his word a secret power, so that it enters into dead souls, as he himself declares, </p><p>The hour cometh, when the dead shall hear the voice of <LineBreak />the Son of God, and they who hear shall live, (<span class="bvs">Joh_5:25</span>.) </p></div>
