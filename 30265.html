<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Salute, etc. </em>As he writes his Epistle generally to the Hebrews, it is strange that he bids some, separate from the rest, to be saluted; but he sends this salutation, as I think, more particularly to the rulers, as a mark of honor, that he might conciliate them, and gently lead them to assent to his doctrine. And he adds, — </p><p><em>And all the saints. </em>He either means the faithful from among the Gentiles, and refers to them that both Jews and Gentiles might learn to cultivate unity among themselves; or his object was to intimate, that they who first received the Epistle, were to communicate it to others. </p><p>END OF THE COMMENTARIES ON THE EPISTLE<LineBreak />TO THE HEBREWS </p></div>
