<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>And confirmed in the faith. </em>He now repeats without a figure the same thing that he had expressed by metaphors, — that the prosecution of the way, the support of the root, and of the foundation, is firmness and steadfastness of faith. And observe, that this argument is set before them in consequence of their having been well instructed, in order that they may safely and confidently secure their footing in the faith with which they had been made acquainted. </p><p><em>Abounding</em>. He would not have them simply remain immovable, but would have them grow every day more and more. When he adds, <em>with thanksgiving</em>, he would have them always keep in mind from what source faith itself proceeds, that they may not be puffed up with presumption, but may rather with fear repose themselves in the gift of God. And, unquestionably, ingratitude is very frequently the reason why we are deprived of the light of the gospel, as well as of other divine favors. </p></div>
