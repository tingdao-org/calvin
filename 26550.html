<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Yes, Lord. </em>To prove that she believes what she had heard Christ say about himself, that <em>he is the resurrection and the life</em>, Martha replies, that <em>she believes that he is the Christ, and the Son of God</em>; and indeed this knowledge includes the sum of all blessings; for we ought always to remember for what purpose the Messiah was promised, and what duty the prophets ascribe to him. Now when Martha confesses that <em>it was he who was to come into the world</em>, she strengthens her faith by the predictions of the prophets. Hence it follows, that we ought to expect from him the full restoration of all things and perfect happiness; and, in short, that he was sent to erect and prepare the true and perfect state of the kingdom of God. </p></div>
