<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这民比我强盛，现在求你来为我咒诅他们，或者我能得胜，攻打他们，赶出此地。因为我知道，你为谁祝福，谁就得福。你咒诅谁，谁就受咒诅。</div></div>
