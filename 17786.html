<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华对以赛亚说，你和你的儿子施亚雅述出去，到上池的水沟头，在漂布地的大路上，去迎接亚哈斯。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Then said the LORD. </em>First, we see how God, remembering his covenant, anticipates this wicked king by sending the Prophet to meet him; for he does not wait for his prayers, but of his own accord promises that he will grant deliverance. <em>His son Shear-jashub </em>is joined with the Prophet as a witness of the prediction, and there is reason to believe that his name, <em>Shear-jashub</em>, was not given at random, but by the secret inspiration of the Spirit, or by an immediate command of God, and in order to point out the future deliverance of the people. He, therefore, carried in his name what might be regarded as an engraven seal, both of the approaching captivity and of the return. It is also probable that this symbol of the prediction was generally known, for he would not have been joined with his father on any other account than because he bore in his person some authority. </p><p><em>To the way of the fuller’s field. </em>The place is mentioned in order to give authenticity to the history. It is possible that the king, for the purpose of repelling the enemy, may have set out to watch his approach, which appears more clearly from the sacred history. (<span class="bvs">2Kg_18:17</span>.) It is called <em>the way of the fuller’s field</em>, perhaps because it was customary to wash clothes there, or because the name arose out of some ancient occurrence. However that may be, it was an evidence of anxiety and dread, that this wretched hypocrite was running about in all directions, when Isaiah came forth to meet him and to soothe his mind. </p></div>
