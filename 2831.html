<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又要把所有的脂油都取下，正如取平安祭羊羔的脂油一样。祭司要按献给耶和华火祭的条例，烧在坛上。至于所犯的罪，祭司要为他赎了，他必蒙赦免。</div></div>
