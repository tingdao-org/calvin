<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那时，使徒和长老并全教会，定意从他们中间拣选人，差他们和保罗，巴拿巴，同往安提阿去。所拣选的，就是称呼巴撒巴的犹大，和西拉，这两个人在弟兄中是作首领的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>It pleased the apostles. </em>That tempest was made calm not without the singular grace of God, so that after the matter was thoroughly discussed, they did all agree together in sound doctrine. Also the modesty of the common people is gathered by this, because, after that they had referred the matter to the judgment of the apostles and the rest of teachers, they do now also subscribe to their decree; and, on the other side, the apostles did show some token of their equity, in that they set down nothing concerning the common cause of all the godly without admitting the people. For assuredly, this tyranny did spring from the pride of the pastors, that those things which appertain unto the common state of the whole Church are subject (the people being excluded) to the will, will not say lust, of a few.<span class="cite-ref">(143)</span> We know what a hard matter it is to suppress the slanders of the wicked, to satisfy most men who are churlish and forward, to keep under the light and unskillful, to wipe away errors conceived, to heal up hatred, to appease contentions, [and] to abolish false reports. Peradventure, the enemies of Paul and Barnabas might have said that they had gotten letters by fair and flattering speeches; they might have invented some new cavil; the rude and weak might, by and by, have been troubled; but when chief men come with the letters, that they may gravely dispute the whole matter in presence, all sinister suspicion is taken away.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(143)</span></p><p>“Prudenter vero Apostoli et Presbyteri Judam et Silam mittendos censuerunt, quo res minus suspecta esset ,” but the apostles prudently deemed it proper to send Judas and Silas, that there might be less ground for suspicion, omitted. </p></div></div>
