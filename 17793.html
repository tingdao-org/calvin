<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华又晓谕亚哈斯说，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And Jehovah added to speak to Ahaz. </em><span class="cite-ref">(108)</span> As the Lord knew that King Ahaz was so wicked as not to believe the promise, so he enjoins Isaiah to confirm him by adding a sign; for when God sees that his promises do not satisfy us, he makes additions to them suitable to our weakness; so that we not only hear him speak, but likewise behold his hand displayed, and thus are confirmed by an evident proof of the fact. Here we ought carefully to observe the use of signs, that is, the reason why God performs miracles, namely, to confirm us in the belief of his word; for when we see his power, if we have any hesitation about what he says to us, our doubt is removed by beholding the thing itself; for miracles added to the word are seals. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(108)</span><em>Moreover, the LORD spake again to Ahaz</em>. — Eng. Ver. </p></div></div>
