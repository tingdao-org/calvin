<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为在我怒中有火烧起，直烧到极深的阴间，把地和地的出产尽都焚烧，山的根基也烧着了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>For a fire is kindled in mine anger. </em>He confirms what went before, but more generally; for He compares His anger to a burning fire<em>, </em>which should penetrate to the deepest abysses, and should utterly consume their land, so as not to spare the very roots of the mountains. This metaphor is, indeed, of frequent occurrence; but here more is expressed by it than in other passages. In the same sense also it is presently added, that God would spend all his scourges and arrows upon them; since, when His implacable anger is once aroused, there are no bounds to His severity. The verb <span class="lang he-il">אספה</span><em>aspheh, </em>may, however, also be taken for to <em>heap, </em>or to <em>superadd</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(270)</span> but I willingly follow the more received interpretation, viz., that God will not omit anything to destroy them, as if He would apply to this purpose all weapons which were at hand. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(270)</span> It will be seen that <em>C</em>. translates both the verbs in this verse, <span class="lang he-il">אספה</span><em>aspheh, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">אכלה</span>, <em>acalleh, </em>by the same word, <em>consumam; </em>whilst <em>A. V</em>. renders the first <em>I will heap, </em>and the latter, <em>I will spend</em>; in accordance with the view of Ainsworth, Mareldus, and Dathe. </p></div></div>
