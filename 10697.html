<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又杀了一个埃及人。埃及人身高五肘，手里拿着枪，枪杆粗如织布的机轴。比拿雅只拿着棍子下去，从埃及人手里夺过枪来，用那枪将他刺死。</div></div>
