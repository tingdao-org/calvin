<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你的箭锋快，射中王敌之心。万民仆倒在你以下。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Thy arrows are sharp, etc. </em>Here the Psalmist again refers to warlike power, when he says that the <em>arrows </em>of the king shall be sharp, so that they shall pierce the <em>hearts of his enemies; </em>by which he intimates that he has weapons in his hand with which to strike, even at a distance, all his enemies, whoever they may be, who resist his authority. In the same sense also he says that <em>the people shall fall under him; </em>as if it had been said, Whoever shall engage in the attempt to shake the stability of his kingdom shah miserably perish, for the king has in his hand a sufficiency of power to break the stubbornness of all such persons. </p></div>
