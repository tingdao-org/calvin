<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">听他们说预言的百姓必因饥荒刀剑抛在耶路撒冷的街道上，无人葬埋。他们连妻子带儿女，都是如此。我必将他们的恶倒在他们身上（或作我必使他们罪恶的报应临到他们身上）。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This then was the reason why God so severely visited the Jews, who had been deceived by false teachers: it was owing to their previous impiety and ingratitude. And on this account also he adds at the end of the verse, <em>I will pour forth upon them their wickedness </em>Some think that the word <span class="lang he-il">רעה</span>,<em>roe, </em>may denote punishment as well as wickedness, as <span class="lang he-il">עון</span>,<em>oun, </em>also is taken for both. But the Prophet seems to give a reason why God had resolved to execute so dreadful a judgment on the Jews; and the reason was, because they were worthy of such a reward. I am therefore inclined to render the word wickedness, as though he had said, “A dreadful calamity indeed awaits this people; but that they may not complain of my severity, they shall receive the reward of their own wickedness.” However this may be, the Prophet no doubt wished here to close the mouths of the Jews, that they might not proceed in their evasions, as though God treated them with too little kindness. Hence then it appears, that God does not heedlessly execute his vengeance on the innocent; but that the teachers and the whole people, who approved of them, were involved in the same punishment. <span class="cite-ref">(117)</span></p><p>And he says, <em>They shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem by the famine and the sword, </em>or on account of the famine and the sword. They shall then all of them, that is, their carcases<em>, </em>be cast out; for their carcases are evidently meant, as he immediately adds, <em>and no one shall bury them; </em>and he mentions their wives and children. And these had no excuse for themselves, for we have seen in the seventh chapter that this charge was brought against them, rothat the children gathered wood, that the parents kindled the fire, and that the women kneaded the dough to make cakes for their idols. The Prophet then intimates, that no one would escape, because they were all implicated in the same wickedness, some more and some less, but so far, however, that the children were not to go unpunished, because they followed their fathers, nor the wives, because they followed the example of their husbands. It follows — </p><p><strong>(117)</strong> These two verses are differently connected by some: the words, “these prophets,” at the end of the fifteenth verse, are joined with the “the people” in the next verse; and this construction is evidently the best, — </p><p><strong>15.</strong>Therefore, thus saith Jehovah, — As to the prophets who prophesy in my name, (Though I have not sent them, yet they say, — The sword and the famine shall not be in this land) By the sword and by the famine shall they perish: </p><p><strong>16.</strong>These prophets, and the people, to whom they prophesy, Shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem, On account of the famine and the sword; And there <em>will be </em>none to bury them — <em>Neither </em>them, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters; Thus will I pour upon them their own wickedness. </p><p>The preceding connection is favored by the <em>Septuagint </em>and the <em>Arabic, </em>but the other versions do not join the “prophets” and the “people” together. “Their own wickedness” is “their own evils” in the <em>Septuagint, </em>— “their own evil” in the <em>Vulgate, </em>— and “their own wickedness” in the <em>Syriac. </em>If rendered “wickedness,” then it is a metonymy for the fruit or effect of wickedness; if “evil” then the meaning is, the evil due to them. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
