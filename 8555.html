<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列人回答犹大人说，按支派，我们与王有十分的情分。在大卫身上，我们也比你们更有情分。你们为何藐视我们，请王回来不先与我们商量呢？但犹大人的话比以色列人的话更硬。</div></div>
