<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with. </em>As the Samaritans were despised by the Jews, so the Samaritans, on the other hand, held the Jews in contempt. Accordingly, this woman at first not only disdains Christ but even mocks at him. She understands quite well that Christ is speaking figuratively, but she throws out a jibe by a different figure, intending to say, that he promises more than he can accomplish. </p></div>
