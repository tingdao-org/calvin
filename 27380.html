<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又在旷野容忍他们约有四十年。（容忍或作抚养）</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>He suffered their manners. </em>The compound verb hath greater force and grace in the Greek, whereby the mercifulness of God is expressed in suffering the people, whom he knew to be stubborn and disobedient. And Paul giveth us to understand again, that the election of God was the cause that his goodness did strive with the wickedness of the people. <span class="cite-ref">(800)</span> Notwithstanding, we must note that God did so take pity upon his elect people, whilst that he will continue firm in his purpose, that he did, notwithstanding, sharply punish the rebellious and wicked. He spared the people indeed, so that he did not quite destroy them, as he might by good right; but he found also means that their wickedness might not remain unpunished. And so that of Isaiah was fulfilled, </p><p>“If the multitude shall be as the sand of the sea, <LineBreak />a remnant shall be saved,” (<span class="bvs">Isa_10:22</span>.) </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(800)</span> “Sustinendo populo,” in sustaining the people. </p></div></div>
