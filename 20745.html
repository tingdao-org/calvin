<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人子阿，若有一国犯罪干犯我，我也向他伸手折断他们的杖，就是断绝他们的粮，使饥荒临到那地，将人与牲畜从其中剪除。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The next verse thought to be joined: for some interpreters altogether pervert the Prophet’s sense by finishing the sentence there, as if he had said, I will extend my hand over it, &amp;e. But the sentence is dependent, as we shall see — </p></div>
