<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">风随着意思吹，你听见风的响声，却不晓得从哪里来，往哪里去。凡从圣灵生的，也是如此。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>The wind bloweth where it pleaseth. </em>Not that, strictly speaking, there is will in the <em>blowing</em>, but because the agitation is free, and uncertain, and variable; for the air is carried sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another. How this applies to the case in hand; for if it flowed in a uniform motion like water, it would be less miraculous. </p><p><em>So is every one that is born of the Spirit. </em>Christ means that the movement and operation of the Spirit of God is not less perceptible in the renewal of man than the motion of the air in this earthly and outward life, but that the manner of it is concealed; and that, therefore, we are ungrateful and malicious, if we do not adore the inconceivable power of God in the heavenly life, of which we behold so striking an exhibition in this world, and if we ascribe to him less in restoring the salvation of our soul than in upholding the bodily frame. The application will be somewhat more evident, if you turn the sentence in this manner: <em>Such is the power and efficacy of the Holy Spirit in the renewed man </em></p></div>
