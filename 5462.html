<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">后来你若不喜悦她，就要由她随意出去，决不可为钱卖她，也不可当婢女待她，因为你玷污了她。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her</em>. I have been compelled to separate this sentence from the foregoing context which I have explained elsewhere; <span class="cite-ref">(161)</span> for Moses there gave instructions how a captive woman was to be taken to wife if her beauty attracted a Jewish husband. That law then had reference to chastity and conjugal fidelity, and especially to the purity of God’s worship; but now Moses prescribes that, if a man have dishonored a captive woman, he should not sell her, but let her go free, and by this satisfaction wipe out, or at any rate diminish, the injury. Hence we infer that this rule of justice depends on the Eighth Commandment, Let none defraud another. This condition was at least tolerable for the captive; for, although chastity is a special treasure, yet liberty, which is justly called an inestimable blessing, was no trifling consolation to her. The penalty, then, of lust, was that the conqueror should lose his booty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(161)</span><em>Vide </em>vol. 2, p. 70. </p></div></div>
