<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他拚命杀那非利士人，耶和华为以色列众人大行拯救。那时你看见，甚是欢喜，现在为何无故要杀大卫，流无辜人的血，自己取罪呢？</div></div>
