<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他对我说，顺着空地的南屋北屋，都是圣屋。亲近耶和华的祭司当在那里吃至圣的物，也当在那里放至圣的物，就是素祭，赎罪祭，和赎愆祭，因此处为圣。</div></div>
