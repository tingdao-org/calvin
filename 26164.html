<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">有一个撒玛利亚的妇人来打水。耶稣对她说，请你给我水喝。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong>A woman came from Samaria. When he asks water from the woman, he does it not merely with the intention of obtaining an opportunity to teach her; for thirst prompted him to desire to drink. But this cannot hinder him from availing himself of the opportunity of instruction which he has obtained, for he prefers the salvation of the woman to his own wants. Thus, forgetting his own thirst, as if he were satisfied with obtaining leisure and opportunity for conversation, that he might instruct her in true godliness, he draws a comparison between the visible water and the spiritual, and waters with heavenly doctrine the mind of her who had refused him water to drink. </p></div>
