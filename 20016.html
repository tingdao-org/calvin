<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们却不听从，不侧耳而听，不转离恶事，仍向别神烧香。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>And he adds, <em>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to alien gods </em>Here God charges the Jews with irreclaimable obstinacy, for the teaching of the Law did not retain them in obedience, nor did they attend to it, though often and at different times warned and admonished by the Prophets. And their perverseness he still more clearly sets forth by the second clause, when he says that they did <em>not incline their ear </em>Had he said, “They have not <em>hearkened</em>, ” it would have been quite sufficient; but when he adds, “They have not inclined their ear,” he expresses, as I have said, something worse than contempt, even that they designedly rejected the teaching of the Prophets, that they disdained to hear the Prophets or to listen to their admonitions, but became willingly deaf, nay, closed up their ears, as rebels do, who are said elsewhere to harden their heart. We now then understand the import of this verse. </p></div>
