<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>To whom thou gavest testimony. </em>By this argument they endeavor either to make Christ inferior to John, or to show that John, by doing him honor, had laid him under obligations; for they reckon that John conferred a favor on Christ by adorning him with such honorable titles. As if it had not been the duty of John to make such a proclamation, or rather, as if it had not been John’s highest dignity to be the herald of the Son of God. Nothing could have been more unreasonable than to make Christ inferior to John, because his testimony was highly favorable; for we know what John’s testimony was. The expression which they use — <em>all men come to Christ </em>— is the language of envious persons, <span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> and proceeds from sinful ambition; for they are afraid that the crowd will immediately forsake their master. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(67)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est une parole de gens envieux</span>.” </p></div></div>
