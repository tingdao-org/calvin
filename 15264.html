<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">如此住在你殿中的，便为有福。他们仍要赞美你。（细拉）</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>Blessed are they who dwell in thy house. </em>Here the Psalmist expresses more distinctly the proper and legitimate use of the sanctuary; and thus he distinguishes himself from hypocrites, who are sedulously attentive to the observance of outward ceremonies, but destitute of genuine heart godliness. David, on the contrary, testifies, that the true worshippers of God offer to him the sacrifice of praise, which can never be dissociated from faith. Never will a man praise God from the heart, unless, relying upon his grace, he is a partaker of spiritual peace and joy. </p></div>
