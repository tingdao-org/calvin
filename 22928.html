<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">与我说话的天使回答我说，你不知道这是什么意思吗？我说，主阿，我不知道。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He calls the angel his <em>Lord</em>, according to the custom of the Jews; for they were wont thus to address those who were eminent in power, or in anything superior. He did not call him Lord with the intention of transferring to him the glory of God; but he thus addressed him only for the sake of honor. And here again we are reminded, that if we desire to become proficient in the mysteries of God, we must not arrogate any thing to ourselves; for here the Prophet honestly confesses his own want of knowledge. And let us not at this day be ashamed to lie down at God’s feet, that he may teach us as little children; for whosoever desires to be God’s disciple must necessarily be conscious of his own folly, that is, he must come free from a conceit of his own acumen and wisdom, and be willing to be taught by God. </p></div>
