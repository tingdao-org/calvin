<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,"</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>I truly, </em>etc. As the Corinthians were wanting in their duty, having condemned their negligence, he now shows what ought to be done. In order that this stain may be removed, they must cast out this incestuous person from the society of the faithful. He prescribes, then, as a remedy for the disease, excommunication, which they had sinfully delayed so long. When he says, that he had, <em>while absent in body</em>, already determined this, he severely reproves in this way the remissness of the Corinthians, for there is here all implied contrast. It is as though he had said: “You who are <em>present </em>ought before this time to have applied a remedy to this disease, having it every day before your eyes, and yet you do nothing; <span class="cite-ref">(274)</span> while for my part I cannot, even though <em>absent</em>, endure it.” Lest any one should allege that he acted rashly in forming a judgment when at so great a distance, he declares himself to be <em>present in spirit</em>, meaning by this, that the line of duty was as plain to him as if he were present, and saw the thing with his eyes. Now it is of importance to observe what he teaches as to the mode of excommunication. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(274)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vous dissimulez</span>;” — “You connive.” </p></div></div>
