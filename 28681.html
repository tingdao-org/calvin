<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>He that prophesieth, speaketh unto men </em>“Prophecy,” says he, “is profitable to all, while a foreign language is a treasure hid in the earth. What great folly, then, it is to spend all one’s time in what is useless, and, on the other hand, to neglect what appears to be most useful!” To <em>speak to edification, </em>is to speak what contains doctrine fitted to edify. For I understand this term to mean doctrine, by which we are trained to piety, to faith, to the worship and fear of God, and the duties of holiness and righteousness. As, however, we have for the most part need of goads, while others are pressed down by afflictions, or labor under weakness, he adds to doctrine, <em>exhortation and consolation </em>It appears from this passage, and from what goes before, that <em>prophecy </em>does not mean the gift of foretelling future events: but as I have said this once before, I do not repeat it. </p></div>
