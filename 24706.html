<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那文士对耶稣说，夫子说，神是一位，实在不错。除了他以外，再没有别的神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mar_12:32</span><strong>.</strong><em>Master, thou hast spoken well, and with truth. Mark </em>alone mentions that the <em>scribe </em>was softened down; and it is worthy of notice that, though he had attacked Christ maliciously, and with the intention of taking him by surprise, not only does he silently yield to the latter, but openly and candidly assents to what Christ had said. Thus we see that he did not belong to the class of those enemies whose obstinacy is incurable; for, though they have been a hundred times convinced, yet they do not cease to oppose the truth in some manner. From this reply it may also be concluded, that Christ did not precisely include under these two words the rule of life, but embraced the opportunity which presented itself for reproving the false and hypocritical holiness of the scribes, who, giving their whole attention to outward ceremonies, almost entirely disregarded the spiritual worship of God, and cared little about brotherly kindness. Now though the scribe was infected by such corruptions, yet, as sometimes happens, he had obtained from the Law the seed of right knowledge, which lay choked in his heart, and on that account he easily allows himself to be withdrawn from the wicked custom. </p></div>
