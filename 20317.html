<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">锡安城的威荣（城原文作女子下同）全都失去。她的首领像找不着草场的鹿。在追赶的人前无力行走。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He continues the same subject. He says here that the daughter of Sion was denuded of all her ornaments. Now, we know what was the honor or dignity of that people; for Moses, in order to set forth the greatness of God’s grace, exclaims, </p><p>“What nation so illustrious under heaven!” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Deu_4:7</span>.) </p><p>As, then, the singular gifts of God had been conferred on that people, it was a very sad spectacle to see that city, which once possessed the highest glory, robbed of all its honor and covered with disgrace, as we shall hereafter see. He then says that all her <em>glory </em>was taken away from the daughter of Sion. </p><p>Now, there is no need to enumerate all the kinds of honor or glory which belonged to the city Jerusalem. But it may be said first, that God had chosen there a habitation for himself; and then a sacerdotal kingdom was there, — the people were holy to God — they were his heritage, — there God had deposited his covenant, — he deemed all the Jews his children, and his will was that they should in return count him as their Father. As, then, they had been enriched with so many ornaments and so superior, it is no wonder that the Prophet deplored the state of the city when stripped of all its glory. </p><p>He then adds, that <em>her princes were like famished harts </em>for harts, as they are by nature swift, when pressed by want run as though they were flying. Since then the swiftness of that animal is so great, the Prophet says that the princes, who were wont to walk with so much gravity and to carry the appearance of great authority, had become swift, like harts oppressed with hunger; for they also labored under the want of everything. <span class="cite-ref">(127)</span> He adds that at length they <em>went away</em>, that is, they fled <em>before their pursuers without strength</em>. He intimates by these words that they dared not to contend with their enemies, but that they were so frightened that they fled, and thus proved that they were wholly disheartened and lifeless. It follows, — </p><p><strong>(127)</strong> The idea here is somewhat different: the princes are compared to harts reduced and enfeebled by famine, so that they were driven by their enemies like a herd of tame cattle. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
