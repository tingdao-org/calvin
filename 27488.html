<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">于是众教会信心越发坚固，人数天天加增。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>The churches were confirmed. </em>By this we gather, that that which Luke setteth down, or rather touched concerning the decrees of the apostles, was, as it were, put in by the way, being not much appertinent unto the matter.<span class="cite-ref">(176)</span> For he commendeth a far other fruit of Paul’s doctrine, when he saith that the churches were confirmed in the faith. Therefore Paul did so order external things, that he was principally careful for the kingdom of God, which consisteth in the doctrine of the gospel, and doth far surpass and surmount external order. Therefore those decrees were mentioned, inasmuch as they were expedient for maintaining concord, that we might know that the holy man had a care thereof. But religion and godliness hath the former place, whose sole foundation is faith; which again doth stay itself upon the pure Word of God, and doth not depend upon men’s laws. Now, by this example, Luke pricketh us forward to proceed continually, lest, at the beginning, sloth or neglect of profiting come upon us. Also the way to increase faith is expressed, to wit, when the Lord doth stir us up by the industry of his servants; as at that time he used the labor and diligence of Paul and his companions. When he addeth immediately that they were also increased in number, he commendeth another fruit of preaching, and yet he doth therewithal signify unto us, that the more those profit in faith who are first called, the more do they bring unto Christ; as if faith did creep abroad unto others by branches.<span class="cite-ref">(177)</span></p><p><strong>(176)</strong></p><p>“ Accessorium,” accessory. </p><p><strong>(177)</strong></p><p>“ Propagine,” by propagation. </p></div>
