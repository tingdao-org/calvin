<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们先上船开往亚朔去，意思要在那里接保罗。因为他是这样安排的，他自己打算要步行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>When we had taken ship. </em>It is uncertain why Paul did choose rather to go by land, whether it were because sailing might be to him troublesome, or that as he did pass by he might visit the brethren. I think that he did then eschew the sea for his health’s sake. And his courtesy is greatly to be commended, in that he spared his companions. For to what end did he suffer them to depart, save only that he might ease them of the trouble? So that we see that they did strive among themselves in courtesy and good turns. They were ready and willing to do their duty; but Paul was so far from requiring things straitly<span class="cite-ref">(407)</span> at their hands, that of his own accord and courtesy he did remit those duties which they were ready to do; yea, setting aside his own commodity, he commanded them to do that which was for their comfort. It is well known that the city Assos is by the describers of countries<span class="cite-ref">(408)</span> attributed to Troas. The same, as Pliny doth witness, was called Appollonia. They say that it was a free city of the AEtolians. </p><p><strong>(407)</strong></p><p>“ Rigidus exactor,” from being a rigid exactor. </p><p><strong>(408)</strong></p><p>“ Geographis,” geographers. </p></div>
