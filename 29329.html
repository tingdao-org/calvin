<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Husbands, love your wives. </em>From husbands, on the other hand, the apostle requires that they cherish toward their wives no ordinary love; for to them, also, he holds out the example of Christ, — <em>even as Christ also loved the church. </em>If they are honored to bear his image, and to be, in some measure, his representatives, they ought to resemble him also in the discharge of duty. </p><p><em>And gave himself for it. </em>This is intended to express the strong affection which husbands ought to have for their wives, though he takes occasion, immediately afterwards, to commend the grace of Christ. Let husbands imitate Christ in this respect, that he scrupled not to die for his church. One peculiar consequence, indeed, which resulted from his death, — that by it he redeemed his church, — is altogether beyond the power of men to imitate. </p></div>
