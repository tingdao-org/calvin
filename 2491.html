<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华对摩西说，你这所求的我也要行，因为你在我眼前蒙了恩，并且我按你的名认识你。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also </em>He adds nothing new, but confirms by repetition what He had just said, in order to remove all doubt. Still He declares that He is induced by no other reason than by the gratuitous favor wherewith He had embraced Moses. This, therefore, is a kind of renewal of the Covenant, when the people is consecrated to God, so as to recover again the sacerdotal kingdom. </p></div>
