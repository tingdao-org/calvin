<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">有你们那里的人，作基督耶稣仆人的以巴弗问你们安。他在祷告之间，常为你们竭力地祈求，愿你们在神一切的旨意上，得以完全。信心充足，能站立得稳。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>Always striving. </em>Here we have an example of a good pastor, whom distance of place cannot induce to forget the Church, so as to prevent him from taking the care of it with him beyond the sea. We must notice, also, the strength of entreaty that is expressed in the word <em>striving</em>. For although the Apostle had it in view here to express intensity of affection, he at the same time admonishes the Colossians not to look upon the prayers of their pastor as useless, but, on the contrary, to reckon that they would afford them no small assistance. Lastly, let us infer from Paul’s words, that the <em>perfection </em>of Christians is, when they <em>stand complete in the will of God</em>, that they may not suspend their scheme of life upon anything else. </p></div>
