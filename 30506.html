<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又判定所多玛，蛾摩拉，将二城倾覆，焚烧成灰，作为后世不敬虔人的鉴戒。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>The cities of Sodom. </em>This was so memorable an example of Divine vengeance, that when the Scripture speaks of the universal destruction of the ungodly, it alludes commonly to this as the type. Hence Peter says, that these cities were made an example. This may, indeed, be truly said of others; but Peter points out something singular, because it was the chief and a lively image; yea, rather, because the Lord designed that his wrath against the ungodly should be made known to all ages; as when he redeemed his people from Egypt, he has set forth to us by that one favor the perpetual safety of his Church. Jude has also expressed the same thing, calling it the punishment of eternal fire. [<span class="bvs">Jud_1:7</span>.] </p></div>
