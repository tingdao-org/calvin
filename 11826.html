<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但祭司太少，不能剥尽燔祭牲的皮，所以他们的弟兄利未人帮助他们，直等燔祭的事完了，又等别的祭司自洁了。因为利未人诚心自洁，胜过祭司。</div></div>
