<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他追赶他们，走他所未走的道，坦然前行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>He pursued </em>them. The Prophet again commends, by the greatness of the victory, the extraordinary kindness of God. It is of the highest importance that he obtained it in a country which was unknown to him; for it is difficult and hazardous to pursue enemies in unknown countries; and how great is the value of a knowledge of places is plainly shewn by history, and daily experienced by those who carry on war. That was no obstacle to Abraham; and hence it is still more evident, that he was led and assisted by the hand of God to conduct his followers courageously. </p></div>
