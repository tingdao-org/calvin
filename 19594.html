<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约雅敬王和他众勇士，众首领听见了乌利亚的话，王就想要把他治死。乌利亚听见就惧怕，逃往埃及去了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>It then follows, <em>And when, Jehoiakim the king, and all his mighty men and the princes, heard his words, etc</em>. This verse seems to favor the opinion of those who conclude that godly men were the speakers; for they spoke dishonorably of the king and his counsellors; the king heard and his mighty men, (powerful men, literally,) and also all the princes; and <em>the king sought to slay him </em>These words, however, may also be ascribed to the ungodly and the wicked, for they wished to terrify the common people by first mentioning the king and then the mighty men and the princes. And to seek to kill him, might also have been excused, even that the king could not bear such a reproach without revenging it; for he saw that the Prophet had taken such a liberty as not, to spare the holy city nor the Temple: <em>The king </em>then <em>heard, and his mighty men and princes; </em>and then, <em>the king sought to slay him </em></p><p><em>But when Uriah heard it, he feared and fled </em>This passage teaches us that even the faithful servants of God, who strive honestly to fulfill their office, are yet not always so courageous as boldly to despise all dangers; for it is said that the Prophet <em>feared; </em>but he was not on this account condemned. This fear was not indeed blameless; but his fear was such, that he yet continued in his vocation. He might indeed have pleased the king, but he dreaded such perfidy more than death. He, therefore, so feared, that he turned not aside from the right course, nor denied the truth., nor admitted anything unworthy of his dignity or of the character he sustained. His fear then, though wrong, did not yet so possess the Prophet, but that he was ever faithful to God in his vocation. It then follows, that he <em>went into Egypt </em>We hence conclude, that the king’s wrath and cruelty were so great, that the holy man could not find a corner to hide himself in through the whole land of Judea, nor even in other regions around. He was therefore forced to seek a hiding place in Egypt. </p></div>
