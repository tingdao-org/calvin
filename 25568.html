<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And thou shalt be blessed. </em>Christ pronounces those to be <em>blessed </em>who exercise liberality without any expectation of earthly reward; for they manifestly look to God. Those who constantly keep in view their own advantage, or who are driven by the gale of popularity, have no right to expect a reward from God. </p></div>
