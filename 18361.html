<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">拉伯沙基回去，正遇见亚述王攻打立拿。原来他早听见亚述王拔营离开拉吉。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And Rabshakeh having returned. </em>He now declares how Rabshakeh, without doing anything, returned to his king, not to the same place where he had left him; for he understood that he had raised the siege of Lachish, and had departed into Egypt for the purpose of attacking Libnah. Some think that this city is Pelusium, others choose rather to assign it to Judea. It is, indeed, probable that, in consequence of a report that reached him about the approach of enemies, he moved his camp towards Egypt, that by meeting them he might prevent them from advancing. Though God restrained the violence of the tyrant by a new war, in order to give some relief to the Jews, yet he did not wish to conquer the tyrant by the hand of man, but only to shew openly and, as it were, to display on a theater his unconquerable pride; because, even when he was in great danger, he did not cease to vomit out the same blasphemies, as we shall soon see. </p></div>
