<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>52.</strong><em>Art thou also from Galilee? </em>They say that all who favor Christ are <em>from Galilee</em>, and this is spoken reproachfully, as if he could not have any person among his followers except from the small and unknown corner of <em>Galilee </em><span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> The extreme violence to which they are excited against Nicodemus, shows with what furious hatred they burned against Christ; for he had not avowedly undertaken to defend Christ, but had only said that <em>he ought not to be condemned before he was heard </em>Thus among the Papists in our own day, no man can show the slightest token of candour that the Gospel may not be oppressed, but immediately the enemies fly into a passion, and exclaim that he is a heretic. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(205)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De ce petit coin incognee de Galilee</span>.” </p></div></div>
