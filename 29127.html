<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但这因信得救的理，既然来到，我们从此就不在师傅的手下了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>But after that faith is come</em>. This phrase has been already considered. It denotes the brighter revelation of grace after that “the vail of the temple was rent in twain,” (<span class="bvs">Mat_27:51</span>,) which, we know, was effected by the manifestation of Christ. He affirms that, under the reign of Christ, there is no longer any childhood which needs to be placed under a schoolmaster, and that, consequently, the law has resigned its office, — which is another application of the comparison. There were two things which he had undertaken to prove, — that the law is a preparation for Christ, and that it is temporal. But here the question is again put, Is the law so abolished that we have nothing to do with it? I answer, the law, so far as it is a rule of life, a bridle to keep us in the fear of the Lord, a spur to correct the sluggishness of our flesh, — so far, in short, as it is </p><p>“profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that believers may be instructed in every good work,” (<span class="bvs">2Ti_3:16</span>,) </p><p>— is as much in force as ever, and remains untouched. </p><p>In what respect, then, is it abolished? Paul, we have said, looks at the law as possessing certain qualities, and those qualities we shall enumerate. It annexes to works a reward and a punishment; that is, it promises life to those who keep it, and curses all transgressors. Meanwhile, it requires from man the highest perfection and most exact obedience. It makes no abatement, gives no pardon, but calls to a severe reckoning the smallest offenses. It does not openly exhibit Christ and his grace, but points him out at a distance, and only when hidden by the covering of ceremonies. All such qualities of the law, Paul tells us, are abolished; so that the office of Moses is now at an end, so far as it differs in outward aspect from a covenant of grace. </p></div>
