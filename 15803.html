<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他向百姓施行救赎，命定他的约，直到永远。他的名圣而可畏。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>He sent redemption to his people </em>What he had already stated is here repeated in different words. And as the deliverance of his people was the commencement of their salvation, it is first introduced; next is subjoined its confirmation in the law, by reason of which it comes to pass that God’s adoption could never fail. For though, long prior to this, God had established his covenant with Abraham, which also was the occasion of the redemption of the people; yet what is here mentioned refers exclusively to the law, by which the covenant was ratified, never to be disannulled. The amount is, that, in the deliverance of the people, God did not act the part of a beneficial father, merely for a day, but that, in the promulgation of the law, he also establishedhis grace, that the hope of eternal life might continue for ever in the Church. Moreover, you must attend carefully to what I have elsewhere cautioned you against, and to which I shall advert more at length on <span class="bvs">Psa_119:0</span>, where the law is spoken of, That the commandments must not be taken always abstractly, for the Holy Spirit, in an especial manner, refers to the promises which are in Christ, by which God, in gathering his chosen people to himself, hath begotten them again to eternal life. </p></div>
