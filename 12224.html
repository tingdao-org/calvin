<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我求王拨步兵马兵帮助我们抵挡路上的仇敌，本以为羞耻。因我曾对王说，我们神施恩的手必帮助一切寻求他的。但他的能力和忿怒，必攻击一切离弃他的。</div></div>
