<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们要如此奉我的名为以色列人祝福。我也要赐福给他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And they shall put my name. </em>Although <em>Jerome </em>has rightly translated this, “They shall call upon my name:” yet since the Hebrew phrase is emphatic, I have preferred retaining it; for God deposits His name with the priests, that they may daily bring it forward as a pledge of His good will, and of the salvation which proceeds from thence. The promise, which is finally subjoined, gives assurance that this was no empty or useless ceremony, when He declares that He will bless the people. And hence we gather, that whatsoever the ministers of the Church do by God’s command, is ratified by Him with a real and solid result; since He declares nothing by His ministers which He will not Himself fulfill and perform by the efficacy of His Spirit. But we must observe that He does not so transfer the office of blessing to His priests, as to resign this right to them; for after having entrusted this ministry to them, He claims the accomplishment of the thing for Himself alone. </p></div>
