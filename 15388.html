<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们经过的日子，都在你震怒之下。我们度尽的年岁好像一声叹息。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>For all our days are passed away in thy indignation. </em>This might be viewed as a general confirmation of the preceding sentence, That the whole course of man’s life is suddenly brought to an end, as soon as God shows himself displeased. But in my opinion Moses rather amplifies what he has said above concerning the rigour of God’s wrath, and his strict examination of every case in which he punishes sin. He asserts that this terror which God brought upon his people was not only for a short time, but that it was extended without intermission even to death. He complains that the Jews had almost wasted away by continual miseries; because God neither remitted nor mitigated his anger. It is therefore not surprising to find him declaring that their years passed away like a <em>tale, </em>when God’s anger rested upon them so unremittingly. </p></div>
