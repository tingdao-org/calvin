<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Every one as a father</em>. He insists more especially on those things which belong to his office. He has compared himself to a <em>nurse: </em>he now compares himself to a <em>father</em>. What he means is this — that he was concerned in regard to them, just as a <em>father </em>is wont to be as to his sons, and that he had exercised a truly paternal care in instructing and admonishing them. And, unquestionably, no one will ever be a good pastor, unless he shews himself to be a <em>father </em>to the Church that is committed to him. Nor does he merely declare himself to be such to the entire body, <span class="cite-ref">(533)</span> but even to the individual members. For it is not enough that a pastor in the pulpit teach all in common, if he does not add also particular instruction, according as necessity requires, or occasion offers. Hence Paul himself, in <span class="bvs">Act_20:26</span>, declares himself to be <em>free from the blood of all men</em>, because he did not cease to admonish all publicly, and also individually in private in their own houses. For instruction given in common is sometimes of little service, and some cannot be corrected or cured without particular medicine. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(533)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tout le corps de ceste Eglise-la</span>;” — “The whole body of the Church there.” </p></div></div>
