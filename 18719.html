<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他被欺压，在受苦的时候却不开口。（或作他受欺压却自卑不开口）他像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声，他也是这样不开口。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>He was punished. </em>Here the Prophet applauds the obedience of Christ in suffering death; for if his death had not been voluntary, he would not have been regarded as having satisfied for our disobedience. “As by one man’s disobedience,” says Paul, “all became sinners, so by one man’s obedience many were made righteous. (<span class="bvs">Rom_5:19</span>) And elsewhere, “He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.” (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:8</span>) This was the reason of his silence at the judgment­seat of Pilate, though he had a just defense to offer; for, having become answerable for our guilt, he wished to submit silently to the sentence, that we might loudly glory in the righteousness of faith obtained through free grace. </p><p><em>As a lamb shall he be led to the slaughter. </em>We are here exhorted to patience and meekness, that, following the example of Christ, we may be ready to endure reproaches and cruel assaults, distress and torture. In this sense Peter quotes this passage, showing that we ought to become like Christ our Head, that we may imitate his patience and submissiveness. (<span class="bvs">1Pe_2:23</span>) In the word <em>lamb </em>there is probably an allusion to the sacrifices under the Law; and in this sense he is elsewhere called “the Lamb of God.” (<span class="bvs">Joh_1:29</span>) </p></div>
