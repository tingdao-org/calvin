<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And thou shalt say unto them. </em>The law is now extended to strangers, not those who were heathens, but those who, springing originally from other nations, had devoted themselves to pure religion. For, if more had been allowed to them than to the genuine children of Abraham, the corruption would, according to their wont, have soon spread more widely. God, then, would not have His sanctuary defiled by foreigners, lest their liberty might make its way amongst the whole people. From this latter portion we may gather that the word “kill” <span class="cite-ref">(205)</span> which is elsewhere taken in a sense, is here confined to the sacrifices; since permission is elsewhere given to the people to eat (meat) in all their cities and villages, provided they abstain from blood. We must remember, therefore, that the question is not here as to their ordinary food, but only as to the victims, which were never to be offered except at the tabernacle. </p><p><strong>(205)</strong> In these verses (<span class="bvs">Lev_27:8</span>) the offering of a burnt-offering, or sacrifices, is only spoken of, from whence <em>C. </em>appears justly to conclude that the word “kill” in <span class="bvs">Lev_27:3</span>, referred merely to animals killed in sacrifice. </p></div>
