<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">无不口称耶稣基督为主，使荣耀归与父神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. </em>It might also be read, <em>In the glory</em>, because the particle <span class="lang el-gr">εἰς</span> (to) is often used in place of <span class="lang el-gr">ἐν</span> (<em>in</em>.) I prefer, however, to retain its proper signification, as meaning, that as the majesty of God has been manifested to men through Christ, so it shines forth in Christ, and the Father is glorified in the Son. See <span class="bvs">Joh_5:17</span>, and you will find an exposition of this passage. </p></div>
