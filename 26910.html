<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And not one of his disciples dared to ask him. </em>It may be inquired, What hindered them? Was it shame arising from reverence, or was it any thing else? But if Christ saw that they were in a state of uncertainty, he ought to remove their doubt, as he had done on many other occasions. I reply, there was no other reason for shame, but because they were not sufficiently certain that he was the Christ; for it is not usual with us to inquire about matters that are doubtful and obscure. The Evangelist, therefore, means that the disciples <em>did not ask </em>Christ, because they were afraid of doing him wrong; so plain and manifest were the signs by which he had made himself known to them. </p></div>
