<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">素来饱足的，反作佣人求食。饥饿的，再不饥饿。不生育的，生了七个儿子。多有儿女的，反倒衰微。</div></div>
