<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约瑟醒了，起来，就遵着主使者的吩咐，把妻子娶过来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Joseph, being raised from sleep </em>The ready performance, which is here described, serves not less to attest the certainty of Joseph’s faith, than to commend his obedience. For, if every scruple had not been removed, and his conscience fully pacified, he would never have proceeded so cheerfully, on a sudden change of opinion, <em>to take unto him his wife, </em>whose society, he lately thought, would pollute him. <span class="cite-ref">(114)</span> The dream must have carried some mark of Divinity, which did not allow his mind to hesitate. Next followed the effect of faith. Having learned the will of God, he instantly prepared himself to obey. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(114)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Laquelle un peu auparavant il ne vouloit recevoir, et lui sembloit qu'il se fust pollue en conversant avec elle</span>;” — “whom a little before he refused to receive, and seemed to him that he would be polluted by conversing with her.” </p></div></div>
