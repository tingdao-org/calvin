<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">主耶和华对你们如此说，我真发愤恨如火，责备那其余的外邦人和以东的众人。他们快乐满怀，心存恨恶，将我的地归自己为业，又看为被弃的掠物。</div></div>
