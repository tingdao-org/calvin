<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">参孙就把心中所藏的都告诉了她，对她说，向来人没有用剃头刀剃我的头，因为我自出母胎就归神作拿细耳人。若剃了我的头发，我的力气就离开我，我便软弱像别人一样。</div></div>
