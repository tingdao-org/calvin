<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为他离弃我，敬拜西顿人的女神亚斯他录，摩押的神基抹，和亚扪人的神米勒公，没有遵从我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，守我的律例典章，像他父亲大卫一样。</div></div>
