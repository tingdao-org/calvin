<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">叫你们凡事富足，可以多多施舍，就借着我们使感谢归于神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>May be enriched unto all bountifulness. </em>Again he makes use of the term <em>bountifulness, </em>to express the nature of true liberality — when, </p><p>casting all our care upon God, (<span class="bvs">1Pe_5:7</span>,) </p><p>we cheerfully lay out what belongs to us for whatever purposes He directs. He teaches us <span class="cite-ref">(729)</span> that these are the true riches of believers, when, relying upon the providence of God for the sufficiency of their support, they are not by distrust kept back from doing good. Nor is it without good reason, that he dignifies with the title of affluence the satisfying abundance of a mind that is simple, and contented with its moderate share; for nothing is more famished and starved than the distrustful, who are tormented with an anxious desire of having. </p><p><em>Which produces through you. </em>He commends, in consideration of another result, the alms which they were about to bestow — that they would tend to promote the glory of God. He afterwards, too, expresses this more distinctly, with amplification, in this way: “Besides the ordinary advantage of love, they will also produce thanksgiving.” Now he amplifies by saying, that <em>thanks will be given to God by many, </em>and that, not merely for the liberality itself, by which they have been helped, but also for the entire measure of piety among the Corinthians. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(729)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Or yci il nous remonstre et donne a entendre</span>;” — “Now here he shows us and gives us to understand.” </p></div></div>
