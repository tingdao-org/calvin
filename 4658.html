<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">寡妇或是被休的妇人所许的愿，就是她约束自己的话，都要为定。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>But every vow of a widow. </em>I have stated why widows are expressly named, viz., lest a woman should think that by a second marriage she would escape, as being no longer free, and again under the yoke; since by such subtle excuses people often extricate themselves. No other subject is referred to down to the end of the last verse but one; for they have made a very gross mistake, who interpret it as applying to a family and its master. <span class="cite-ref">(327)</span> The subject itself certainly does not admit of such an explanation; and the words of Moses forbid it: so that it is the more surprising that persons skilled in the Hebrew language have not seen the matter clearly. </p><p><strong>(327)</strong><span class="bvs">Num_30:10</span>, <span class="lang he-il">ואם-בית אישה</span>. Literally, “And if the house of her husband.” <em>C</em>. and <em>A.V. </em>follow <em>LXX. </em>in assuming that the preposition <em>in </em>should be supplied before <em>the house. S.M., </em>on the other hand, translates the word <span class="lang he-il">בית</span><em>, family, </em>which is undeniably allowable; but says in a note, “By family, is to be understood the wife here, as the chief personage in it after its master.” To this treatment of the text <em>C</em>. here adverts, as strange on the part of one so skillful in the Hebrew tongue. — <em>W </em></p></div>
