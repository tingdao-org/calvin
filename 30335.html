<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在何处有嫉妒分争，就在何处有扰乱，和各样的坏事。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>For where envying is</em>. It is an argument from what is contrary; for envying, by which hypocrites are influenced, produces effects contrary to wisdom.

For James meant to express something more than levity, even that the malignant and the slanderer does everything confusedly and rashly, as though he were beside himself; and hence he adds, <em>every evil work </em></p></div>
