<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">乃要均平。就是要你们的富余，现在可以补他们的不足，使他们的富余，将来也可以补你们的不足，这就均平了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And their abundance </em>It is uncertain, what sort of <em>abundance </em>he means. Some interpret it as meaning, that this had been the case, inasmuch as the Gospel had flowed out to them from the Church at Jerusalem, from which source they had, in their penury, been assisted by their spiritual riches. This, I think, is foreign to Paul’s intention. It ought rather, in my opinion, to be applied to the communion of saints, which means, that whatever duty is discharged to one member, redounds to the advantage of the entire body. “If it is irksome to you to help your brethren with riches that are of no value, consider how many blessings you are destitute of, and these too, far more precious, with which you may be enriched by those who are poor as to worldly substance. This participation, which Christ has established among the members of his body, should animate you to be more forward, and more active in doing good.” The meaning may, also, be this. “You now relieve them according to the necessity of the occasion, but they will have an opportunity given them at another time of requiting you.” <span class="cite-ref">(679)</span> I approve rather of the other sentiment, which is of a more general nature, and with this accords what he again repeats in reference to equality. For the system of proportional right in the Church is this — that while they communicate to each other mutually according to the measure of gifts and of necessity, this mutual contribution produces a befitting symmetry, though some have more, and some less, and gifts are distributed unequally. <span class="cite-ref">(680)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(679)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quelque tour Dieu leur donnera. moyen de vous recompenser</span>;” — “God will one day give them the means of requiting you.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(680)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Fait vne proportion fort conuenable, et comme vne belle harmonie</span>;” — “Makes a very suitable proportion, and as it were a beautiful harmony.” </p></div></div>
