<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我观看，不料，无人。空中的飞鸟也都躲避。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>What he saw the third time was solitude; for he says that there were <em>no men</em>, and that all <em>birds </em>had fled away. The principal ornament of the world, we know, consists of men and of living creatures. For why was the earth made so productive, that it brings forth fruits, so many and so various, except for the sake of men and of animals? Though, then, the earth appears very beautiful on account of its trees, herbs, and every kind of fruit, yet its principal ornaments are men and animals. By stating a part for the whole, the Prophet, by mentioning birds, includes all earthly animals: he says then, that the earth was emptied of its inhabitants. </p></div>
