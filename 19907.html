<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">于是以伯米勒带领这些人同去，进入王宫，到库房以下，从那里取了些碎布和破烂的衣服，用绳子缒下牢狱去到耶利米那里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here Jeremiah goes on with the history of his deliverance. The courage of Ebedmelech ought ever to be noticed by us, for he went immediately to the holy Prophet. And it is said, that he <em>took </em>from some hidden place <em>old tatters, </em><em class="lang fr-fr">De vieux haillons </em><em>, </em>as we call them. It is properly a noun substantive. But if its harshness be displeasing, we may give this rendering, <em>“old </em>tatters which had been dragged, and old tatters which were rotten.” Yet some render the words thus, “Worn out clothes and rotten clothes.” But the former is more properly the meaning; for <span class="lang he-il">סחב</span>, <em>sacheb, </em>means to drag, and it may be rendered in French, <em class="lang fr-fr">Vieux haillons trainez, ou, qui avoyent traine </em> Then we have <span class="lang he-il">סלחים</span>, <em>salechim, corrupted </em>or marred, <em class="lang fr-fr">usez </em><em>; </em>for <span class="lang he-il">סלח</span>, <em>salech, </em>means to salt; but it is a verb in <em>Hophal, </em>and in that form it means to corrupt. They were torn or rotten garments, <em class="lang fr-fr">des vieux haillons a demi pourris </em> It is said then that Ebedmelech took these old, torn, and rotten garments, and which had been used. This ought to be carefully noticed; for it appears that Ebed-melech was afraid of the violence of the princes, not so much on his own account, but lest he should be hindered in effecting his purpose. </p><p>For if he had provided other things, he might have been apprehended; report might have been brought to the princes, who would have immediately assembled and put a stop to his efforts. There is then no doubt but that Ebedmelech, being very confident, prudently considered what might prevent him in his attempt of bringing help to the holy Prophet. Hence it was, that he stealthily took from a hidden place these worn-out and marred garments. This is one thing. Then we see the miserable state of the holy Prophet; he lay half buried in mud, and he was to be drawn out by ropes or cords, and to have these torn and worn-out garments under his arms. And we are afterwards expressly told for what purpose these clothes were sent down to him. </p></div>
