<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>Believe in the light. </em>He exhorts them to retain by faith the possession of <em>the light</em>, for he gives the appellation,<em>children of light</em>, to those who, like true heirs, enjoy it to the end. </p><p><em>These things spoke Jesus. </em>We might have wondered why he withdrew himself from them, when they were so eager to receive him; but from the other Evangelists it may easily be inferred that what is here said relates to adversaries, who burned with envy on account of the godly zeal of good and sincere disciples. For the strangers, who had gone out to meet Christ, followed him even to the temple, where he met with the saints and with the multitude of the inhabitants of the town. </p></div>
