<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And they shall be afraid. </em>He now shews for whose benefit he had foretold these things about the Egyptians and Ethiopians. It was in order that the Jews might learn amidst their afflictions to hope in God, and might not have recourse to foreign aid, which the Lord had forbidden. </p></div>
