<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">攻城的迦勒底人必来放火焚烧这城和其中的房屋。在这房屋上，人曾向巴力烧香，向别神浇奠，惹我发怒。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>And therefore he adds, <em>enter in shall the Chaldeans who assail the city; </em>for he does not say that they would come, but he confirms in other words what he had said; <em>Break </em>then <em>into the </em>city shall the Chaldeans, though it was closed up and fortified; <em>and shall set on fire this city </em>It was not without purpose that he mentioned the word city so often; for as it was the sanctuary of God, and the royal seat, the Jews thought that it was impregnable, and that the sun could be sooner cast down from heaven than that; enemies could take possession of it: in order then to subvert this false confidence, God often mentioned the word city. He at last adds, that the Chaldeans would <em>burn </em>it, as though he had said, that whatever Jeremiah had predicted would certainly be fulfilled, not only respecting the attack on the city, but also its destruction, so that not a stone would be left on a stone, but that there would be a dreadful desolation until the time of its restoration. The rest to-morrow. </p></div>
