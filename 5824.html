<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">论约瑟说，愿他的地蒙耶和华赐福，得天上的宝物，甘露，以及地里所藏的泉水。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And of Joseph he said. </em>Moses repeats some portions of the blessing of Jacob; nor with respect to any other tribe does he approach so closely to the words of the Patriarch. And, although the family of Joseph was already divided into two tribes or nations, still he begins by the head itself, and at the conclusion declares that what had been given to their fathers pertains to Ephraim and Manasseh. First, he celebrates the exceeding fertility of the land, in which the descendants of Joseph were to dwell; and then ratifies his testimony by the authority of God. He promises them, then, that their land shall be fertile, from the best treasures of heaven; for <span class="lang he-il">מגד</span>, <em>meged, </em>signifies whatever is best and most precious. I do not, therefore, approve of their translation, who render it <em>fruits, </em>although I know not whether Moses speaks of the excellency of the climate, or commends the beneficence of God; the latter, however, accords best with the context, in which he makes mention of the external means of fertility, viz., the dew, and the deep, by which word I understand the depth of the soil itself. In the next verse I admit that by the word <span class="lang he-il">מגד</span>, <em>meged, </em>the choicest fruits are indicated, but without any change of its meaning. Others render it <em>delicacies: </em>others <em>sweet fruits, </em>on account of the peculiar excellency of the fruits. But I do not see why some translate the word <span class="lang he-il">גרש</span>, ge<em>resh, </em>“influence.” It literally means <em>thrusting out; </em>and is used metaphorically for the fruit, which arises and breaks forth from the earth. But it is not very clear to me what fruits he speaks of respectively as “of the sun, and the moon;” for I cannot tell whether there are any grounds for assigning, as some do, to the sun the produce which springs from seed and the vintage; and to the moon, cucumbers and gourds; nor do I attempt to decide whether their idea is more correct who suppose the latter to be flowers or fruits which appear every month. </p></div>
