<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那时，有许多祸患灾难临到他们，这歌必在他们面前作见证，他们后裔的口中必念诵不忘。我未领他们到我所起誓应许之地以先，他们所怀的意念我都知道了。</div></div>
