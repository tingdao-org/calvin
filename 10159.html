<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们去为我，为民，为犹大众人，以这书上的话求问耶和华。因为我们列祖没有听从这书上的言语，没有遵着书上所吩咐我们的去行，耶和华就向我们大发烈怒。</div></div>
