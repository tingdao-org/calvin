<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这样，必叫你们丰丰富富地，得以进入我们主救主耶稣基督永远的国。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He explains the way or means of persevering, when he says, <em>an entrance shall be ministered to you. </em>The import of the words is this: “God, by ever supplying you abundantly with new graces, will lead you to his own kingdom.” And this was added, that we may know, that though we have already passed from death into life, yet it is a passage of hope; and as to the fruition of life, there remains for us yet a long journey. In the meantime we are not destitute of necessary helps. Hence Peter obviates a doubt by these words, “The Lord will abundantly supply your need, until you shall enter into his eternal kingdom.” He calls it the <em>kingdom of Christ, </em>because we cannot ascend to heaven except under his banner and guidance. </p></div>
