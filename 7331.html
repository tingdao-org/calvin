<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">于是打发人去请非利士的众首领来，说，愿你们将以色列神的约柜送回原处，免得害了我们和我们的众民。原来神的手重重攻击那城，城中的人有因惊慌而死的。</div></div>
