<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">好使水旁的诸树不因高大而自尊，也不将树尖插入云中，并且那些得水滋润，有势力的，也不得高大自立。因为它们在世人中，和下坑的人都被交与死亡，到阴府去了。</div></div>
