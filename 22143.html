<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">将来民如何，祭司也必如何，我必因他们所行的惩罚他们，照他们所做的报应他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet here again denounces on both a common punishment, as neither was free from guilt. <em>As the people</em>, he says, <em>so shall be the priest</em>; that is “I will spare neither the one nor the other; for the priest has abused the honor conferred on him; for though divinely appointed over the Church for this purpose, to preserve the people in piety and holy life, he has yet broken through and violated every right principle: and then the people themselves wished to have such teachers, that is, such as were mute. I will therefore now” the Lord says, “inflict punishment on them all alike. As the people then, so shall the priest be.” </p><p>Some go farther, and say, that it means that God would rob the priests of their honor, that they might differ nothing from the people; which is indeed true: but then they think that the Prophet threatens not others as well as the priests; which is not true. For though God, when he punishes the priests and the people for the contempt of his law, blots out the honor of the priesthood, and so abolishes it as to produce an equality between the great and the despised; yet the Prophet declares here, no doubt, that God would become the vindicator of his law against other sinners as well as against the priests. This subject expands wider than what they mean. The rest we must defer till to-morrow. </p></div>
