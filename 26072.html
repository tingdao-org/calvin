<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Who coming after me</em>. Here he says two things; first, that Christ was behind him in the order of time; but, secondly, that he was far before him in rank and dignity, because the rather preferred him to all. Soon after he will add a third statement, that Christ was preferred to all others, because he is in reality more exalted than all others. </p></div>
