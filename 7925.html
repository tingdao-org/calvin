<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">求我主我王听仆人的话，若是耶和华激发你攻击我，愿耶和华收纳祭物。若是人激发你，愿他在耶和华面前受咒诅。因为他现今赶逐我，不容我在耶和华的产业上有分，说，你去事奉别神吧。</div></div>
