<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，诸天要称赞你的奇事。在圣者的会中，要称赞你的信实。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And the heavens shall praise thy wondrous work. </em>The prophet, having spoken of God’s covenant, even as faith ought to begin at the word, now descends to a general commendation of his works. It is, however, to be observed, that when he treats of the wonderful power of God, he has no other end in view than to exalt and magnify more highly the holiness of the covenant. He exclaims, that this is the God who has rightful claims to be served and feared, who ought to be believed, and upon whose power the most unhesitating confidence may be reposed. The words <em>wondrous work, </em>in the first clause, I would therefore limit to the power which God displays in preserving and maintaining his Church. The heavens, it is true, are most excellent witnesses and preachers of God’s wonderful power; but from attending to the scope of the passage, it will be still more evident, that the encomiums here pronounced have all a special reference to the end of which I have spoken. Some interpreters judiciously explain the word <em>heavens, </em>of the angels, among whom there is a common joy and congratulation in the salvation of the Church. This interpretation is confirmed from the last clause of the verse, in which it is asserted, that <em>God’s truth will be celebrated in the congregation of the saints </em>There is no doubt, that the same subject is here prosecuted, and that by the word <em>truth, </em>it is intended to signalise the remarkable deliverances by which God had manifested his faithfulness to the promises made to his servants. </p></div>
