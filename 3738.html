<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你拣选利未人代替以色列人所有头生的，也取利未人的牲畜代替以色列人的牲畜。利未人要归我。我是耶和华。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>Take the Levites instead of all the first-born </em>The compensation of which I have spoken follows; for, since the complete portion of God was not found in the tribe of Levi, it must needs be supplied from elsewhere. Since, then, the Levites, infants as well as men, were less by two hundred and seventy-three than the first-born of the twelve tribes of Israel, God required that five shekels of the sanctuary should be paid for every head. We have elsewhere seen that the shekel of the sanctuary was double, amounting to two ordinary ones. </p></div>
