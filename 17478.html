<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">凡临到众人的事，都是一样。义人和恶人，都遭遇一样的事。好人，洁净人和不洁净人，献祭的与不献祭的，也是一样。好人如何，罪人也如何。起誓的如何，怕起誓的也如何。</div></div>
