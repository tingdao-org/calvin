<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若有外人寄居在你们中间，愿向耶和华守逾越节，他所有的男子务要受割礼，然后才容他前来遵守，他也就像本地人一样，但未受割礼的，都不可吃这羊羔。</div></div>
