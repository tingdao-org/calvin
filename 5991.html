<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">到了早晨，你们要按着支派近前来。耶和华所取的支派，要按着宗族近前来。耶和华所取的宗族，要按着家室近前来。耶和华所取的家室，要按着人丁，一个一个地近前来。</div></div>
