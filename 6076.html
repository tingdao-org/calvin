<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们在以色列人面前逃跑，正在伯和仑下坡的时候，耶和华从天上降大冰雹在他们身上（冰雹原文作石头），直降到亚西加，打死他们。被冰雹打死的，比以色列人用刀杀死的还多。</div></div>
