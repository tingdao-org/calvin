<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">现在全家的人都起来攻击婢女，说，你将那打死兄弟的交出来，我们好治死他，偿他打死兄弟的命，灭绝那承受家业的。这样，他们要将我剩下的炭火灭尽，不与我丈夫留名留后在世上。</div></div>
