<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">看见天开了，有一物降下，好像一块大布。系着四角，缒在地上。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong>The opening of heaven signifieth, in my judgment, another thing in this place than in the seventh chapter. For it is said there that heaven was opened to Stephen, that he did behold the glory of Christ; in this place Peter saw our heaven which we see divided, so that a sheet came thence. </p></div>
