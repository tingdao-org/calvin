<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">主耶和华如此说，它下阴间的那日，我便使人悲哀。我为它遮盖深渊，使江河凝结，大水停流。我也使利巴嫩为它凄惨，田野的诸树都因它发昏。</div></div>
