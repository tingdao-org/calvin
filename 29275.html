<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">用和平彼此联络，竭力保守圣灵所赐合而为一的心。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit. </em>With good reason does he recommend forbearance, as tending to promote the unity of the Spirit. Innumerable offenses arise daily, which might produce quarrels, particularly when we consider the extreme bitterness of man’s natural temper. Some consider <em>the unity of the Spirit </em>to mean that spiritual unity which is produced in us by the Spirit of God. There can be no doubt that He alone makes us “of one accord, of one mind,” (<span class="bvs">Phi_2:2</span>,) and thus makes us one; but I think it more natural to understand the words as denoting harmony of views. This unity, he tells us, is maintained by <em>the bond of peace; </em>for disputes frequently give rise to hatred and resentment. We must live at peace, if we would wish that brotherly kindness should be permanent amongst us. </p></div>
