<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">锡安的门都陷入地内。主将她的门闩毁坏，折断。她的君王和首领落在没有律法的列国中。她的先知不得见耶和华的异象。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He again relates in other words what he had said, that the walls of Jerusalem had fallen. But he now speaks of the gates and says, that they had <em>sunk into the ground</em>, or had become fixed in the ground; for it may be explained in both ways; as though he had said, that the gates had been no hindrance to the enemies so as to prevent them to enter the city. He thus derides the foolish confidence of the people, who relied on their defenses and thought the city impregnable. He then says that the <em>gates had sunk</em>, or had become fixed <em>in the ground </em></p><p>He then says that God had <em>destroyed and broken her bars</em>; for no doubt the gates had firm and strong bars. He then says that neither the gates nor the bars were found sufficient, when God stretched forth his hand to the Chaldeans, to lead them into the city. He afterwards adds, that both the king and the princes had been driven into exile; for when he says, <em>among the nations</em>, or to the nations, he intimates that there was no more a king, for he and the royal seed and the princes were gone into banishment. The rest I defer until tomorrow. </p></div>
