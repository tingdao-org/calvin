<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们所有的男子，都要受割礼。这就是我与你，并你的后裔所立的约，是你们所当遵守的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Every man-child among you shall be circumcised </em>Although God promised alike to males and females, what he afterwards sanctioned by circumcision, he nevertheless consecrated, in one sex, the whole people to himself. For whereas, by this symbol, the promise which was given, indiscriminately, to males and females, is confirmed, and it is certain that females as well as males had need of confirmation, it is hence evident, that the symbol was ordained for the sake of both sexes. Nor is it of any force in opposition to this reasoning to say that each individual is commanded to communicate in the sacraments, if he would derive any benefit from them, on the ground that no profit is received by those who neglect their use. For the covenant of God was graven on the bodies of the males, with this condition annexed, that the females also should as their associates be partakers of the same sign. </p></div>
