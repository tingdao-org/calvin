<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们这些心中顽梗，远离公义的，当听我言。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Hear me. </em>He again rebukes the Israelites, because they could not place confidence in God, or receive any consolation in adversity. That rebuke is indeed sharp and severe, but was well deserved by those whose hearts were not soothed by any promise, or by any invitation, however gracious, which God addressed to them. </p><p>We ought to observe the two epithets which he employs here, <em>Hardened in heart </em>and <em>Far from righteousness </em>By these expressions he means that poor distressed persons shut the door against God’s assistance on account of their obstinacy; because by murmuring or fretting they shake off the fear of God, and thus throw themselves into despair, so that they openly rage against God. He addresses the Jews, who, though they were almost overwhelmed, yet were swelled with pride and insolence, and, having thrown off the fear of God, rose to more and more outrageous madness; as frequently happens to many persons in the present day, whom distresses and afflictions render more rebellious. Accordingly, they refused to receive any medicine, any remedy for their distresses. If any one prefer to consider the word <em>righteousness </em>to be put for “the assistance of God,” as in the following verse, let him enjoy his opinion, which indeed is not inappropriate; because obstinate men, who refuse to believe the promises of God, drive God away from them, and reject his grace; for they do not suffer God to confer benefits upon them, though he offered to them his assistance. </p></div>
