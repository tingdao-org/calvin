<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And of Benjamin he said. </em>It is probable that Moses alludes to the inheritance which fell to the lot of the children of Benjamin; for the part of Jerusalem in which the temple stood was contained in it. Since, therefore, God assigned them a dwelling-place, in which He in a manner protected them, and cherished them beneath His wings, they are not without reason called His <em>beloved, </em>for this was no ordinary pledge of His love To “dwell upon God,” <span class="cite-ref">(319)</span> and “between his shoulders,” is equivalent to reposing upon Him; a similitude taken from fathers who carry their children whilst yet they are small and tender. Others extract a different meaning, viz., that God would dwell upon the shoulders of Benjamin; but this is very unnatural. <span class="cite-ref">(320)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(319)</span><em>A. V</em>. <em>, “by </em>God.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(320)</span> It is, nevertheless, the exposition of the great majority of commentators, who suppose that by <em>shoulders </em>are figuratively meant <em>mountains, or coasts. </em></p></div></div>
