<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又建筑巴力的丘坛，好在火中焚烧自己的儿子，作为燔祭献给巴力。这不是我所吩咐的，不是我所提说的，也不是我心所起的意。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He at last adds, that that place was <em>filled with the blood of innocents</em>; for there they killed their children. And by this circumstance Jeremiah again amplifies the wickedness of the people; for they had not only despised God and his law, but also cruelly destroyed their innocent infants; and thus he proved them guilty not only of impiety and profaneness in vitiating the worship of God, but also of brutal and barbarous savageness in not sparing innocent blood. </p></div>
