<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">凡作恶的便恨光，并不来就光，恐怕他的行为受责备。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>For whosoever doeth what is evil. </em>The meaning is, that <em>the light </em>is hateful to them for no other reason than because they are wicked and desire to conceal their sins, as far as lies in their power. Hence it follows that, by rejecting the remedy, they may be said purposely to cherish the ground of their condemnation. We are greatly mistaken, therefore, if we suppose that they who are enraged against the Gospel are actuated by godly zeal, when, on the contrary, they abhor and shun the light, that they may more freely flatter themselves in <em>darkness </em></p></div>
