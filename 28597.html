<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>30.</strong><em>If therefore by grace. </em>This argument is similar to the preceding one, or nearly so. “As it is owing to the kindness of God that <em>all things are lawful for me, </em>why should I act in such a manner, that it should be reckoned to my account as a vice?” We cannot, it is true, prevent the wicked from reviling us, nor even the weak from being sometimes displeased with us; but Paul here reproves the forwardness of those, who of their own accord give occasion of offense, and hurt weak consciences, when neither necessity or expediency calls for it. He would have us, then, make a good use of our benefits, <span class="cite-ref">(604)</span> that the weak may not have occasion of reviling from our inconsiderate use of liberty. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(604)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">C’est a dire, de nestre liberte</span>;” — “That is to say, of our liberty.” </p></div></div>
