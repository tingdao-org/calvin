<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王要从这门的廊进入，站在门框旁边。祭司要为他预备燔祭和平安祭，他就要在门槛那里敬拜，然后出去。这门直到晚上不可关闭。</div></div>
