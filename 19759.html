<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我是耶和华，是凡有血气者的神，岂有我难成的事吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>We have already said that the verb <span class="lang he-il">פלא</span><em>pela, </em>admits of two meanings; it means to be hid and to be wonderful, and hence by a metaphor it means what is difficult and impossible. Many take it to mean here, that nothing escapes the observation of God. But as I have said in the last lecture, I am more inclined to refer it to God’s power, even that all things are in the hand and at the pleasure of God, so that there is no difficulty in his way. For whence comes to men so much anxiety, except that they are stopped by obstacles? but God can surmount all obstacles without any labor. That our minds then may not be perplexed, rightly is set before us the power of God. </p><p>And this meaning is most suitable to this passage: for Jeremiah, when that which seemed inconsistent occurred to him, was constrained to cast his anxiety as it were into the bosom of God. Then God, in order to relieve him, says that nothing is difficult to him, because he is the God of all flesh. Though by the words <em>all flesh, </em>the Scripture often means all kinds of animals, yet oftener the human race only. I do not, however, refinedly explain this passage, as though God did set the Gentiles in opposition to the Jews, and thus denied that he would be any longer the God of Abraham’s children, because he had repudiated them on account of their sins; but he says that he is in an especial manner the king of the whole earth, and rules over the whole human race. As God then, he says, is <em>the God of all flesh, can anything be impssible to him? </em></p></div>
