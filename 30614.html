<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亲爱的弟兄阿，神既是这样爱我们，我们也当彼此相爱。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Beloved </em>Now the Almighty accommodates to his own purpose what he has just taught us respecting the love of God; for he exhorts us by God’s example to brotherly love; as also Paul sets before us Christ, who offered himself to the Father a sacrifice of pleasant fragrance, that every one of us might labor to benefit his neighbors. (<span class="bvs">Eph_5:2</span>.) And John reminds us, that our love ought not to be mercenary, when he bids us to love our neighbors as God has loved us; for we ought to remember this, that we have been loved freely. And doubtless when we regard our own advantage, or return good offices to friends, it is self-love, and not love to others. </p></div>
