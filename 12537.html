<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们得了坚固的城邑，肥美的地土，充满各样美物的房屋，凿成的水井，葡萄园，橄榄园，并许多果木树。他们就吃而得饱，身体肥胖，因你的大恩，心中快乐。</div></div>
