<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他的名声就传遍了叙利亚。那里的人把一切害病的，就是害各样疾病，各样疼痛的，和被鬼附的，癫痫的，瘫痪的，都带了来，耶稣就治好了他们。</div></div>
