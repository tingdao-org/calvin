<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那人同他的妾和仆人起来要走，他岳父，就是女子的父亲，对他说，看哪，日头偏西了，请你再住一夜。天快晚了，可以在这里住宿，畅快你的心。明天早早起行回家去。</div></div>
