<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">文士和法利赛人，带着一个行淫时被拿的妇人来，叫他站在当中。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And the scribes and Pharisees bring to him. </em>It is plain enough that this passage was unknown anciently to the Greek Churches; and some conjecture that it has been brought from some other place and inserted here. But as it has always been received by the Latin Churches, and is found in many old Greek manuscripts, and contains nothing unworthy of an Apostolic Spirit, there is no reason why we should refuse to apply it to our advantage. When the Evangelist says that <em>the scribes brought to him a woman, </em>he means that it was done by an agreement among them, in order to lay traps for Christ. He expressly mentions <em>the Pharisees, </em>because they were the chief persons in the rank of <em>scribes </em>In adopting this pretense for slander, they display enormous wickedness, and even their own lips accuse them; for they do not disguise that they have a plain commandment of the Law, and hence it follows that they act maliciously in putting a question as if it were a doubtful matter. But their intention was, to constrain Christ to depart from his office of preaching grace, that he might appear to be fickle and unsteady. They expressly state that adulteresses are condemned by Moses, (<span class="bvs">Lev_20:10</span>,) that they may hold Christ bound by the sentence already given by the Law, for it was not lawful to acquit those whom the Law condemned; and, on the other hand, if he had consented to the Law, he might be thought to be somewhat unlike himself. </p></div>
