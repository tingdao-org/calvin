<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说，要将这封缄的和敞着的两张契放在瓦器里，可以存留多日。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He says, <em>That they may continue for many days </em>By these words he intimates that the prophecy would not only be profitable to the Jews, who were to be driven soon after into captivity, but also to their posterity, who were not yet born, and that they might know that this prophecy would stand valid after their death, for we ought not to measure the faithfulness of God by the extent of our life. This, then, was the reason why this clause was added: the prophecy was to be preserved in earthen vessels, that it might remain safe and secure for many days, that is, until God delivered his people. </p></div>
