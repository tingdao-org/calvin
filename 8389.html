<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">押沙龙回答约押说，我打发人去请你来，好托你去见王，替我说，我为何从基述回来呢？不如仍在那里。现在要许我见王的面。我若有罪，任凭王杀我就是了。</div></div>
