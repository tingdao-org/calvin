<div class="CUV verse">学生不能高过先生，仆人不能高过主人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>The disciple is not above his master </em>By his own example he now exhorts them to perseverance; and, indeed, this consolation is enough to banish all sadness, if we consider that our lot is shared with the Son of God. To make us feel deeper shame, he borrows a twofold comparison from what is customary among men. <em>The disciple </em>reckons it honorable to be placed on a level with <em>his master, </em>and does not venture to wish a higher honor, and again, <em>servants </em>do not refuse to share that condition to which their <em>masters </em>willingly submit. In both respects, the Son of God is far above us: for the Father has given to him the highest authority, and has bestowed on him the office of a teacher. We ought, therefore, to be ashamed of declining what he did not scruple to undergo on our account. But there is more need to meditate on these words than to explain them: for, in themselves, they are sufficiently clear. </p></div>
