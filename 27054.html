<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那许多信的人，都是一心一意的，没有一人说，他的东西有一样是自己的，都是大家公用。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>And the multitude. </em>In this place there are three things commended; that the faithful were all of one mind; that there was a mutual partaking of goods amongst them; that the apostles behaved themselves stoutly in announcing the resurrection of Christ. He saith that the multitude<em>had one heart; </em>because this is far more excellent than if a few men should have a mutual consent. And heretofore he hath declared, that the Church did grow to be about five thousand. And now he saith that there was wonderful concord in so great a multitude, which is a very hard matter. </p><p>And surely where faith beareth the chief sway, it doth so knit the hearts of men together, that all of them do both will and nill one thing. For discord springeth hence because we are not all governed with the same Spirit of Christ. It is well known that by these two words, <em>heart </em>and <em>soul, </em>he meaneth the will. And because the wicked do oftentimes conspire together to do evil, this concord was laudable and holy therefore because it was amongst the faithful. </p><p><em>And no man did say. </em>This is the second member; that they coupled this love with external benefits. But we shall see anon, after what sort they had their goods common. This is now worth the noting in the text of Luke that the inward unity of minds goeth before as the root, and then the fruit followeth after. And surely even we ought to observe the same order, we must love one another, <span class="cite-ref">(230)</span> and then this love of ours must show itself by external effects. <span class="cite-ref">(231)</span> And in vain do we boast of a right affection, unless there appear some testimony thereof in external offices. Moreover, Luke declareth therewithal, that they were not of one mind for any respect of their own commodity, forasmuch as the rich men, when they did liberally bestow their goods, sought nothing less than their own gain. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(230)</span> “Sincero cordis affectu,” with sincere affection of heart, omitted. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(231)</span> “Nam et externa beneficentia nisi oriatur ex corde, nihili est coram Deo,” for even an external beneficence, if it comes not from the heart, is of no value in the sight of God, omitted. </p></div></div>
