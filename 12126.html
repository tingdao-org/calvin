<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">请王考察先王的实录，必在其上查知这城是反叛的城，与列王和各省有害。自古以来，其中常有悖逆的事，因此这城曾被拆毁。</div></div>
