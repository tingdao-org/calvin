<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在安息日的前一日，耶路撒冷城门有黑影的时候，我就吩咐人将门关锁，不过安息日不准开放。我又派我几个仆人管理城门，免得有人在安息日担什么担子进城。</div></div>
