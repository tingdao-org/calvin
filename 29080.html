<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>Which once he destroyed</em>. This does not mean that <em>faith </em><span class="cite-ref">(36)</span> may actually be destroyed, but that he lessened its influence on the minds of weak men. Besides, it is the will, rather than the deed, that is here expressed. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(36)</span> ”The word <span class="lang el-gr">πίστις</span> denotes not only the act of believing, but that which is believed.” — Beza. </p></div></div>
