<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Lest, when I come, my God should humble me </em>His abasement was reckoned to him as a fault. The blame of it he throws back upon the Corinthians, who, when they should have honored his Apostleship, loaded it, on the contrary, with disgrace; for their proficiency <span class="cite-ref">(941)</span> would have been the glory and honor of Paul’s Apostleship. When, therefore, they were, instead of this, overrun with many vices, they heaped disgrace upon him to the utmost of their power. He does not, indeed, charge them all with this crime, but only a few, who had impudently despised all his admonitions. The meaning, then, is this: “They think contemptuously of me, because I appear contemptible. Let them, then, give me no occasion of abasement: nay more, let them, on the contrary, laying aside their forwardness, begin to feel shame; and let them, confounded at their iniquities, prostrate themselves on the ground, instead of looking down upon others with disdain.” </p><p>In the mean time, he lets us know the disposition of a true and genuine Pastor, when he says that he will look upon the sins of others with grief. And, undoubtedly, the right way of acting is this — that every Christian shall have his Church inclosed within his heart, and be affected with its maladies, as if they were his own, — sympathize with its sorrows, and bewail its sins. We see, how Jeremiah entreats, that there may be given him <em>a fountain of tears, </em>(<span class="bvs">Jer_9:1</span>,) that he may bewail the calamity of his people. We see, how pious kings and prophets, to whom the government of the people was committed, were touched with similar feelings. It is, indeed, a thing that is common to all the pious, to be grieved in every case in which God is offended, and to bewail the ruin of brethren, and present themselves before God in their room as in a manner guilty, but it is more particularly requisite on the part of Pastors. <span class="cite-ref">(942)</span> Farther, Paul here brings forward a second catalogue of vices, which, however, belong to one general head — unchastity. </p><p><strong>(941)</strong><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Qu’ils eussent proufite en sainctete de vie</span>;” — “That they had made progress in holiness of life.” </p><p><strong>(942)</strong><span class="cite-ref">“</span><span class="lang fr-fr">Des Pasteurs et Ministres</span>;” — “Of Pastors and Ministers.” </p></div>
