<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_11:1</span><strong>.</strong><em>And it happened that when Jesus had made an end </em>In this passage Matthew means nothing more than that Christ did not desist from the exercise of his office, while the Apostles were laboring in another direction. As soon, therefore, as he sent them away, with the necessary instructions, to perambulate Judea, he performed the duties of a teacher in Galilee. The word <em>commanding, </em>which Matthew employs, is emphatic; for he means that they did not receive a commission to do what they pleased, but were restricted and enjoined as to the statements which they should make, and the manner in which they should conduct themselves. </p></div>
