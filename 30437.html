<div class="CUV verse">你们若是热心行善，有谁害你们呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13</strong><em>Who is he that will harm you </em>He further confirms the previous sentence by an argument drawn from common experience. For it happens for the most part, that the ungodly disturb us, or are provoked by us, or that we do not labor to do them good as it behoves us; for they who seek to do good, do even soften minds which are otherwise hard as iron. This very thing is mentioned by Plato in his first book on the Republic, “Injustice,” he says, “causes seditions and hatreds and fightings one with another; but justice, concord and friendship.” <span class="cite-ref">(41)</span> However, though this commonly happens, yet it is not always the case; for the children of God, how much soever they may strive to pacify the ungodly by kindness, and shew themselves kind towards all, are yet often assailed undeservedly by many. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(41)</span><span class="lang el-gr">Στάσεις γάρ που ἥγε ἀδικία καὶ μίσεα καὶ μάχας ἐν ἀλλήλοις παρέχει, ἡδὲ δικαιοσύνη ὁμόνοιαν καὶ φιλίαν</span>. — Rep. lib. 1. </p></div></div>
