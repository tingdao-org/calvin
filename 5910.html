<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那从上往下流的水便在极远之地，撒拉但旁的亚当城那里停住，立起成垒。那往亚拉巴的海，就是盐海，下流的水全然断绝。于是百姓在耶利哥的对面过去了。</div></div>
