<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">于是希勒家的儿子家宰以利亚敬，并书记舍伯那，和亚萨的儿子史官约亚，出来见拉伯沙基。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And Eliakim went to him. Eliakim </em>was formerly mentioned. It was he to whom the Lord promised that he would give him the chief power in the kingdom after the banishment of Shebna. (<span class="bvs">Isa_22:20</span>.) It now appears as if that promise had failed, when he is sent to an enemy as a suppliant, and as one who is about to surrender himself and his companions, and to undergo cruel tyranny. This might also fill the hearts of believers with anxiety, and lead them to doubt the promises of God. Besides, the godly king had such a scarcity of good men, that, along with Eliakim, he was compelled to send Shebna, whom he knew well to be deceitful and treacherous. </p><p><span class="lang he-il">ספר</span><em>(sopher) </em>means<em>scribe; </em>and accordingly it often denotes learned men or doctors, and sometimes those who took charge of writings and those who had the custody of the royal records. I have translated it <em>chancellor, </em>for unquestionably it does not relate to legal skill; and we may infer that this Shebna held a high rank, though he had been deprived of his office as governor. <span class="lang he-il">מזכיר</span><em>(mazkir) </em>denotes a secretary or recorder. </p></div>
