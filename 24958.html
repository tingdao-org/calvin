<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>64.</strong><em>And his mouth was instantly opened </em>God puts honor on the birth of his prophet by restoring speech to his father: for there can be no doubt that this benefit was delayed till that day with the express object and design of fixing the eyes of men upon John. Zacharias <em>spake, blessing God </em>He did so, not only for the purpose of testifying his gratitude, but to inform his relatives and neighbors, that this punishment had been inflicted on him, because he had been too slow to believe: for he was not ashamed to unite with his own dishonor the praises of the divine glory. Thus it became universally known, that the birth of the child was not an accidental or ordinary event, but had been promised by an announcement from heaven. <span class="cite-ref">(65)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(65)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais selon la promesse expresse de Dieu, qui avoit este apportee et revelee par l'ange</span>.” — “But according to the express promise of God, which had been brought and revealed by the angel.” </p></div></div>
