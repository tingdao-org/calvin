<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Praise ye Jehovah </em>This exhortation supplies the want of a title; not that the psalm contains nothing else than thanksgiving and praise to God, but that the people, from the experience of past favors, may obtain the assurance of reconciliation; and thus entertain the hope that God, although at present offended, would soon be pacified towards them. In celebrating the praises of God, therefore, he orders them to call to mind such things as would have a tendency to assuage their grief on account of present ills, and to animate their spirits, and prevent them from sinking into despair. <span class="cite-ref">(241)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(241)</span> It is the province of faith to celebrate the divine mercy in the most trying circumstances. </p></div></div>
