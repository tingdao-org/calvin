<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">主耶和华说，我指着我的永生起誓，因你用一切可憎的物，可厌的事玷污了我的圣所，故此，我定要使你人数减少，我眼必不顾惜你，也不可怜你。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here God again expresses more clearly why he was so eager to take vengeance namely, because the religion of the Jews was corrupt, and the Temple had been violated, as we shall see to-morrow. </p></div>
