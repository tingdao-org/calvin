<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>Who, knowing the judgement </em><span class="cite-ref">(61)</span><em>of God</em>, <em>etc. </em>Though this passage is variously explained, yet the following appears to me the correctest interpretation, — that men left nothing undone for the purpose of giving unbridled liberty to their sinful propensities; for having taken away all distinction between good and evil, they approved in themselves and in others those things which they knew displeased God, and would be condemned by his righteous judgment. For it is the summit of all evils, when the sinner is so void of shame, that he is pleased with his own vices, and will not bear them to be reproved, and also cherishes them in others by his consent and approbation. This desperate wickedness is thus described in Scripture: </p><p>“They boast when they do evil,” (<span class="bvs">Pro_2:14</span>.) </p><p>“She has spread out her feet,<LineBreak />and gloried in her wickedness,” (<span class="bvs">Eze_16:25</span>.) </p><p>For he who is ashamed is as yet healable; but when such an impudence is contracted through a sinful habit, that vices, and not virtues, please us, and are approved, there is no more any hope of reformation. Such, then, is the interpretation I give; for I see that the Apostle meant here to condemn something more grievous and more wicked than the very doing of vices: what that is I know not, except we refer to that which is the summit of all wickedness, — that is, when wretched men, having cast away all shame, undertake the patronage of vices in opposition to the righteousness of God. </p><p><strong>(61)</strong> [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] has “justitiam “ here, though “judicium “ is given in the text. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
