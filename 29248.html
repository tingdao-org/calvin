<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Now therefore ye are no more strangers. </em>The Ephesians are now exclusively addressed. They were formerly <em>strangers from the covenants of promise, </em>but their condition was now changed. They were <em>foreigners, </em>but God had made them <em>citizens </em>of his church. The high value of that honor which God had been pleased to bestow upon them, is expressed in a variety of language. They are first called <em>fellow-citizens with the saints, </em>— next, <em>of the household of God, </em>— and lastly, stones properly fitted into the building of the temple of the Lord. The first appellation is taken from the comparison of the church to a state, which occurs very frequently in Scripture. Those who were formerly profane, and utterly unworthy to associate with godly persons, have been raised to distinguished honor in being admitted to be members of the same community with Abraham, — with all the holy patriarchs, and prophets, and kings, — nay, with the angels themselves. To be <em>of the household of God, </em>which is the second comparison, suggests equally exalted views of their present condition. God has admitted them into his own family; for the church is God’s house. </p></div>
