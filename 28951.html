<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Which is administered by us. </em>By commending his ministry, he still farther encourages the Corinthians. He says, that it tends to promote the glory of God, and their kindness of disposition. Hence it comes, that these two things are conjoined — the glory of God and their liberality, and that the <em>latter </em>cannot be given up without the <em>former </em>being proportionally diminished. There is, in addition to this, the labor of those distinguished men, which it were very inconsistent to reject, or allow to pass unimproved. </p></div>
