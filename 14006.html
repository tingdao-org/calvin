<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神是我的盾牌。他拯救心里正直的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>My shield </em>It is not wonderful that David often mingles meditations with his prayers, thereby to inspire himself with true confidence. We may go to God in prayer with great alacrity; but our fervour, if it does not gather new strength, either immediately fails or begins to languish. David, therefore, in order to continue in prayer with the same ardour of devotion and affection with which he commenced, brings to his recollection some of the most common truths of religion, and by this means fosters and invigorates his faith. He declares, that as God <em>saves the upright in heart, </em>he is perfectly safe under his protection. Whence it follows, that he had the testimony of an approving conscience. And, as he does not simply say <em>the righteous, </em>but <em>the upright in heart, </em>he appears to have an eye to that inward searching of <em>the heart and reins </em>mentioned in the preceding verse. </p></div>
