<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但我的仇敌又活泼又强壮。无理恨我的增多了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>This <em>living, </em><span class="cite-ref">(58)</span> which he attributes to his enemies, implies as much as to enjoy continued and abundant prosperity in all things; and therefore he adds, that they <em>are become strong and increase in power </em>I interpret the word <span class="lang he-il">רבב</span>, <em>rabbab, </em>in this place, <em>increase in power, </em>because he would speak improperly were he to be understood as saying, <em>that they were multiplied. </em>He does not here complain that they increased in number, but rather exalts their greatness, because the more they acquired of riches, they acquired so much the greater audacity in oppressing the good and the simple. He tells us that he is <em>assailed by them wrongfully, </em>and without cause, that he may induce God to be the more favorable and propitious to him. And surely, if we would have the favor of God for our defense, we must always take care not to injure any man, and to do nothing to provoke the hatred of any against us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(58)</span> Ainsworth reads, “<em>are alive</em>, or <em>living</em>; ” “that is,” says he, “lively, lusty, cheerful, hale, and sound, or rich, as the word seemeth to mean in <span class="bvs">Ecc_6:8</span>.” Dr Lowth, instead of <span class="lang he-il">חיים</span>, <em>chayim</em>, <em>living</em>, proposes to read here <span class="lang he-il">חאנם</span>, <em>chinam</em>, <em>without cause </em>— <em>without cause have strengthened themselves</em>. “I think,” says he, “<span class="lang he-il">חינם</span>, here for <span class="lang he-il">חיים</span>, is a remarkable instance of a reading merely conjectural, unsupported by any authority but that of the context, of the truth of which, no possible doubt can be made. Hare and Houbigant, and I suppose every other competent reader, has hit upon it. You see the two hemistichs are parallel and synonymous, word answering to word.” — <em>Dr Lowth in Mr Merrick </em>’<em>s Note on this place</em>. — Street and Dr Adam Clarke agree in this alteration. </p></div></div>
