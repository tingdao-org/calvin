<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Let all the earth fear Jehovah. </em>The Psalmist concludes that there is just reason why the whole world should reverently submit itself to the government of God, who gave it being, and who also preserves it. <em>To fear Jehovah, </em>and <em>to stand in awe of him, </em>just means to do honor to, and to reverence his mighty power. It is a mark of great insensibility not to bow at God’s presence, from whom we have our being, and upon whom our condition depends. The prophet alludes to both these things, affirming that the world appeared as soon as God spake, and that it is upheld in being by his commandment; for it would not have been enough for the world to have been created in a moment, if it had not been supported in existence by the power of God. He did not employ a great array of means in creating the world, but to prove the inconceivable power of his word, he ordered that so soon as he should as it were pronounce the word, the thing should be done. <span class="cite-ref">(677)</span> The word <em>command, </em>therefore, confirms what I formerly said, that his speech was nothing else than a nod, or wish, and that <em>to speak </em>implies the same thing as to command. It is proper, however, to understand that in this nod, or command, the eternal wisdom of God displayed itself. </p><p><strong>(677)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Il a commande que si tost qu’il auroit comme prononce le mot, la chose aussi se trouvast faire</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
