<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那些成为祭司的，数目本来多，是因为有死阻隔不能长久。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And they truly, etc. </em>He had already touched on this comparison; but as the subject deserved more attention, he unfolds it more fully, though the point discussed is different from what it was before; for then he concluded that the ancient priesthood was to come to an end because they who exercised it were mortal; but now he simply shows that Christ remains perpetually a priest. This he does by an argument taken from things unequal; the ancient priests were many, for death put an end to their priesthood; but there is no death to prevent Christ from discharging his office. Then he alone is a perpetual priest. Thus a different cause produces different effects. </p></div>
