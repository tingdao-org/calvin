<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>23.</strong><em>And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch. </em>The Evangelist gives to <em>Solomon’s porch </em>the designation of<em>the temple</em>; not that it was the sanctuary, but only an appendage to<em>the temple </em>Nor does he mean the ancient <em>porch </em>which was built by <em>Solomon</em>, which had been altogether destroyed by the Chaldeans, but that which the Jews — perhaps immediately after their return from the Babylonish captivity — built after the pattern of the ancient <em>porch</em>, and gave it the same name, that it might be more highly honored; and Herod afterwards built a new temple. </p></div>
