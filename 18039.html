<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以我满腰疼痛。痛苦将我抓住，好像产难的妇人一样。我疼痛甚至不能听。我惊惶甚至不能看。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Therefore are my loins, filled with pain. </em>Here the Prophet represents the people as actually present, for it was not enough to have simply foretold the destruction of Babylon, if he had not confirmed the belief of the godly in such a manner that they felt as if the actual event were placed before their eyes. Such a representation was necessary, and the Prophet does not here describe the feelings of his own heart, as if he had compassion on the Babylonians, but, on the contrary, as we have formerly said, <span class="cite-ref">(67)</span> he assumes, for the time, the character of a Babylonian. <span class="cite-ref">(68)</span> It ought undoubtedly to satisfy our minds that the hidden judgments of God are held out to us, as in a mirror, that they may arouse the sluggishness of our faith; and therefore the Prophets describe with greater beauty and copiousness, and paint in lively colors, those things which exceed the capacity of our reason. The Prophet, thus expressing his grief, informs believers how awful is the vengeance of God which awaits the Chaldeans, and how dreadfully they will be punished, as we are struck with surprise and horror when any sad intelligence is brought to us. </p><p><em>As the pangs of a woman that travaileth. </em>He adds a stronger expression of grief, when he compares it to that of a woman in labor, as when a person under fearful anguish turns every way, and writhes in every part of his body. Such modes of expression are employed by the Prophets on account of our sluggishness, for we do not perceive the judgments of God till they be pointed at, as it were, with the finger, and affect our senses. We are warned to be on our guard before they arrive. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(67)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(68)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
