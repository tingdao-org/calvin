<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们要愁苦，悲哀，哭泣。将喜笑变作悲哀，欢乐变作愁闷。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>Be afflicted and mourn</em>. Christ denounces mourning on those who laugh, as a curse, (<span class="bvs">Luk_6:25</span>;) and James, in what shortly follows, alluding to the same words, threatens the rich with mourning. But here he speaks of that salutary mourning or sorrow which leads us to repentance. He addresses those who, being inebriated in their minds, did not perceive God’s judgment. Thus it happened that they flattered themselves in their vices. That he might shake off from them this deadly torpor, he admonishes them to learn to mourn, that being touched with sorrow of conscience they might cease to flatter themselves and to exult on the verge of destruction. Then <em>laughter </em>is to be taken as signifying the flattering with which the ungodly deceive themselves, while they are infatuated by the sweetness of their sins and forget the judgment of God. </p></div>
