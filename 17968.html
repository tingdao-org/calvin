<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因此，摩押人所得的财物，和所积蓄的，都要运过柳树河。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Therefore what every one hath left. </em><span class="cite-ref">(244)</span> This corresponds to the ordinary expression, (<em class="lang fr-fr">Ce qu’il aura espargne </em>,) <em>Whatever he shall have spared</em>. He means the riches that are laid up, and describes what usually happens in countries which are invaded by an enemy. All the inhabitants are wont to convey their riches elsewhere, and to lay them up in some safe place, that they may afterwards bring them back when peace has been restored. </p><p><em>To the brook of the willows. </em>He means that they will have no storehouse, no fortress in which they can lay them up with safety; so that they will be compelled to hide them among <em>the willows</em>. This certainly is the lowest wretchedness, when the enemy is attacking us, and we can find no storehouse for laying up those things which we have collected with great industry. These <em>willows </em>were probably situated in some remote and sequestered place. Others explain it as referring to enemies, that they will bring the fruits of their robbery <em>to the brook</em>, to divide among themselves the general plunder. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(244)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
