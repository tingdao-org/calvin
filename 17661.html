<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">从脚掌到头顶，没有一处完全的。尽是伤口，青肿，与新打的伤痕。都没有收口，没有缠裹，也没有用膏滋润。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it </em>Here he proceeds with the same comparison, and repeats the same statement; for certainly those who explain the former part of the verse, as referring to punishments, do not sufficiently consider the remaining part of the context. If we shall admit that a nation corrupted by vices is compared to a diseased body, what is the meaning of the words which immediately follow, that <em>the wounds have not been bound up or mollified with ointment </em>? It is plain that the Prophet speaks of afflictions by which the nation had almost wasted away, and that he adduces this long-continued weakness as a proof of hardened impenitence. He calls it a <em>putrifying sore</em>, from which diseased matter is continually flowing, as if some concealed fountain were perpetually sending forth an additional supply of venom. By this comparison he shows that the wound is incurable, because that supply cannot be stopped. All this is prodigiously heightened by affirming that no remedies have been applied; for the three metaphors which he joins together — <em>they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment </em>— have all the same meaning that the nation, without any hope of relief, without comfort, without remedy, is reduced to such a state of distress, that in such punishments the utmost severity of God is openly displayed. </p></div>
