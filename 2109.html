<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Whether he have gored a son</em>. I know not whether they are correct who refer this to age, as if any young persons of either sex were meant by the words son and daughter; but I do not reject this opinion. Still Moses seems to extend the law, as if, in case a butting ox had killed its owner’s son, the father himself should be subject to the punishment, for not having taken more care of his children. It might, however, be doubted, whether it would be just to condemn to death a father already weighed down by the loss of his child; still it affords a useful example, that parents should not escape with impunity, if their sons or daughters should die by their fault. </p></div>
