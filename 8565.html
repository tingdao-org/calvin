<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚玛撒没有防备约押手里所拿的刀。约押用刀刺入他的肚腹，他的肠子流在地上，没有再刺他，就死了。约押和他兄弟亚比筛往前追赶比基利的儿子示巴。</div></div>
