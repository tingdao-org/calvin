<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>That we should be to the praise of his glory. </em>Here again he mentions the <em>final </em>cause of salvation; for we must eventually become illustrations of the glory of God, if we are nothing but vessels of his mercy. The word <em>glory, </em>by way of eminence, (<span class="lang el-gr">κατ ᾿ ἐξοχὴν</span>) denotes, in a peculiar manner, that which shines in the goodness of God; for there is nothing that is more peculiarly his own, or in which he desires more to be glorified, than goodness. </p></div>
