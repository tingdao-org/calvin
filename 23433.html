<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我实在告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛和蛾摩拉所受的，比那城还容易受呢。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>Verily, I say to you </em>That they may not imagine this to be an idle bugbear, <span class="cite-ref">(578)</span> Christ declares that those who reject the gospel, will receive more severe punishment than the inhabitants of Sodom. Some view the word <em>judgment </em>as referring to the destruction of Jerusalem. But this is foreign to our Lord’s intention: for it must be understood as referring to the <em>general judgment, </em>in which both must give their account, that there may be a comparison of the punishments. Christ mentioned <em>Sodom </em>rather than other cities, not only because it went beyond them all in flagitious crimes, but because God destroyed it in an extraordinary manner, that it might serve as an example to all ages, and that its very name might be held in abomination. And we need not wonder if Christ declares that they will be treated less severely than those who refuse to hear the gospel. When men deny the authority of Him who made and formed them, when they refuse to listen to his voice, nay, reject disdainfully his gentle invitations, and withhold the confidence which is due to his gracious promises, such impiety is the utmost accumulation, as it were, of all crimes. But if the rejection of that obscure preaching was followed by such dreadful vengeance, how awful must be the punishment that awaits those who reject Christ when he speaks openly! Again, if God punishes so severely the despisers of the word, what shall become of furious enemies who, by blasphemies and a venomous tongue, oppose the gospel, or cruelly persecute it by fire and sword? </p><p><strong>(578)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Afin qu'il ne semble que ce soit une menace vaine, et (cornroe on dit) seulement pour faire peur aux petits enfans</span>;” — “that it may not seem as if it were an idle threatening, and (as we say) only to frighten young children.” </p></div>
