<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41</strong><em>I am the Lord your God. </em>Having at the end of the last verse commanded them to be holy unto their God, he now confirms this command by a reason, viz., that it was for this end that God redeemed them, that he might be their God, <em>i.e., </em>that He might be solemnly honored. He asserts God’s right, then, as founded upon the blessing of their deliverance, which would have been misplaced unless they devoted themselves to His service. The repetition at the conclusion is intended for confirmation. </p></div>
