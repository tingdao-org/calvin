<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们若说自己没有犯过罪，便是以神为说谎的。他的道也不在我们心里了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10</strong><em>We make him a liar </em>He goes still further, that they who claim purity for themselves blaspheme God. For we see that he everywhere represents the whole race of man as guilty of sin. </p><p>Whosoever then tries to escape this charge carries on war with God, and accuses him of falsehood, as though he condemned the undeserving. To confirm this he adds, <em>and his word is not in us</em>; as though he had said, that we reject this great truth, that all are under guilt. </p><p>We hence learn, that we then only make a due progress in the knowledge of the word of the Lord, when we become really humbled, so as to groan under the burden of our sins and learn to flee to the mercy of God, and acquiesce in nothing else but in his paternal favor. </p></div>
