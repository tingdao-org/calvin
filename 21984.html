<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">至于那折断了的角，在其根上又长出四角，这四角就是四国，必从这国里兴起来，只是权势都不及他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>The great horn, </em>says he, <em>which was between his eyes was the first king, and when it was broken, four others sprang up. </em>Alexander, as we have mentioned, perished in the flower of his age, and was scarcely’ thirty years old when he died, through the influence of either poison or disease. Which of the two is uncertain, although great suspicion of fraud attaches to the manner of his death; and whichever way it happened, that horn was broken. In his place there arose four horns, <em>which sprang up, </em>say’s he, from that nation. Here we must notice this, since I very much wonder what has come into some persons’ minds, to cause them to translate it “from the nations” and yet these are persons skilled in the Hebrew language. First, they show great ignorance by changing the number, and next, they do not comprehend the intention of the angel. For he confirms what he formerly said concerning the unity of the kingdom and its division into four parts, and he assigns the reason here. They shall spring, says he, from <em>a nation, </em>meaning the Greeks, and all from a single origin. For by what right did Polemy obtain the empire? solely by being one of Alexander’s generals. At the beginning, he dared not use the royal name, nor wear the diadem, but only after a lapse of time. The same is true of Selcucus, and Antigonus, and Cassander. We see, then, how correctly the kingdom of the Greeks is represented to us under the figure of a single beast, although it was immediately dispersed and torn into four parts. The kingdoms, then, which sprang from <em>the nation </em>meaning; Greece, <em>shall stand, but not in full strength </em>The copula is here taken in the sense of “but<em>; </em>” <em>the four kingdom </em>shall stand, <em>but not by his strength, </em>for Alexander had touched upon the Indian sea, and enjoyed the tranquil possession of his empire throughout the whole east, having filled all men with the fear of his industry, valor, and speed. Hence, the;angel states the four horns to be so small, that not one of them should be equal to the first king. </p></div>
