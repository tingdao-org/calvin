<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>And carry to the master of the feast. </em>For the same reason as before, Christ wished that the flavor of the wine should be tried by <em>the master of the feast, </em>before it had been tasted by himself, or by any other of the guests; and the readiness with which the servants obey him in all things shows us the great reverence and respect in which he was held by them. The Evangelist gives the name of <em>the master of the feast </em>to him who had the charge of preparing the banquet and arranging the tables; not that the banquet was costly and magnificent, but because the honorable appellations borrowed from the luxury and splendor of the rich are applied even to the marriages of the poor. But it is wonderful that a large quantity of wine, and of the very best wine, is supplied by Christ, who is a teacher of sobriety. I reply, when God daily gives us a large supply of wine, it is our own fault if his kindness is an excitement to luxury; but, on the other hand, it is an undoubted trial of our sobriety, if we are sparing and moderate in the midst of abundance; as Paul boasts that <em>he had learned to know both how to be full and to be hungry</em>, (<span class="bvs">Phi_4:12</span>.) </p></div>
