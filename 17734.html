<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">锡安（原文作他）的城门必悲伤，哀号。他必荒凉坐在地上。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>Her gates shall mourn and lament. </em>Hence arises the <em>mourning of the gates</em>, which, he threatens, will take place when they have met with their calamities; for he means, that where there were great crowds and multitudes, nothing but a dismal solitude will be found. We know that at that time public meetings were held at <em>the gates</em>; and, therefore, as the gates sometimes rejoice at the multitude of citizens, so they are said <em>to mourn </em>on account of their frightful desolation. And yet I do not deny that he compares Jerusalem to a woman who is sad, and who bewails her widowhood; for it was customary with mourners <em>to sit on the ground</em>, as that nation was in the habit of using ceremonies and outward signs to a greater degree than would be consistent with our customs. But the sum of the matter is that the city will have lost her inhabitants. </p></div>
