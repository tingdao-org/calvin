<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我列祖所毁灭的，就是歌散，哈兰，利色，和属提拉撒的伊甸人。这些国的神，何曾拯救这些国呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Gozan. </em>This place is mentioned in <span class="bvs">2Kg_17:6</span>. We may infer that it was a town in Media, though some think that it was situated elsewhere; but it is enough that, with regard to Jerusalem, it lay in an easterly direction. <em>Haran </em>is often mentioned in Scripture. Pliny places this town in Arabia; but it is more generally believed to have been in Mesopotamia, and this is confirmed by the journeyings of Abraham, who came to it along with his father, after having left his native country Chaldaea. (<span class="bvs">Act_7:24</span>; <span class="bvs">Gen_11:31</span>.) It is called Charrae, in the plural number, by heathen historians, who also mention that Crassus and his son were killed there. </p></div>
