<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">要拈阄分这地为业，归与自己和你们中间寄居的外人，就是在你们中间生养儿女的外人。你们要看他们如同以色列人中所生的一样。他们在以色列支派中要与你们同得地业</div></div>
