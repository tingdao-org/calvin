<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华杀百姓的缘故是因他们同亚伦作了牛犊。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>And the Lord plagued the people </em>Moses here briefly attributes to God what he had before related as to the slaughter of the three thousand, lest any should think that he had smitten them with immoderate severity Therefore Paul bids us consider in this history, as in a mirror, how greatly displeasing to God idolatry is; lest we should imitate those who were smitten by His hand. (<span class="bvs">1Co_10:7</span>.) The indignation of Moses is consequently connected with the command of God. Meanwhile he commends the mercy of God in having spared Aaron, whilst he speaks of the calf as his work, as well as of the whole of the people; in a different way indeed, for Aaron formed the calf at their request; still the criminality was common to them. </p></div>
