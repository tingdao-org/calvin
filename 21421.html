<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">也不再因偶像和可憎的物，并一切的罪过玷污自己。我却要救他们出离一切的住处，就是他们犯罪的地方。我要洁净他们，如此，他们要作我的子民，我要作他们的神。</div></div>
