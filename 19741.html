<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我便向我叔叔的儿子哈拿篾买了亚拿突的那块地，平了十七舍客勒银子给他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards adds, that he <em>bought the field of Hanameel his uncle’s son, which was in Anathoth, </em>in <em>the land of Benjamin </em>There is nothing superfluous in these words, for though the Prophet speaks of places well known, yet he had a regard to the time of the purchase, for the land of Benjamin was then in the power of enemies: the Jews had been reduced to such straits that they were not safe at Jerusalem. Anathoth was a village, as it was well known, exposed to the ravages of enemies, and was seized on as a prey at their first coming. And he adds, <em>in the land of Benjamin, </em>for it was nigh the borders of Judah, but it had been forsaken by its inhabitants, and all had fled to Jerusalem. As then the land of Benjamin had no inhabitant, it was by no means reasonable for the Prophet to pay even the smallest sum for a field there. </p></div>
