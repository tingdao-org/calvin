<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">埃及像尼罗河涨发，像江河的水翻腾。他说，我要涨发遮盖遍地。我要毁灭城邑和其中的居民。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Then he adds, <em>Egypt </em>is like <em>rivers </em>and like a <em>lake</em>: it made a noise with its forces, as though a river were rolling along its waters. But all this would be nothing, as he afterwards tells us he adds, he <em>hath said, I will ascend, I will cover the land, I will destroy the city, etc</em>. He puts city in the singular instead of the plural number; <span class="cite-ref">(134)</span> I <em>will destroy cities, </em>he says, <em>and all who dwell in them. </em>He in short sets forth Pharaoh here as one who triumphed before he fought, because he could cover the land with the multitude of his footmen and horsemen. It now follows, — </p><p><strong>(134)</strong> The <em>city </em>here is put in opposition to the <em>land, </em>— And it (Egypt) said, I will ascend, I will cover the land; I will destroy (every) city, and the dwellers in it. </p></div>
