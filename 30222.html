<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">生身的父都是暂随己意管教我们。惟有万灵的父管教我们，是要我们得益处，使我们在他的圣洁上有分。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>For they verily for a few days, etc. </em>The second amplification of the subject, as I have said, is that God’s chastisements are appointed to subdue and mortify our flesh, so that we may be renewed for a celestial life. It hence appears that the fruit or benefit is to be perpetual; but such a benefit cannot be expected from men, since their discipline refers to civil life, and therefore properly belongs to the present world. It hence follows that these chastisements bring far greater benefit, as the spiritual holiness conferred by God far exceeds the advantages which belong to the body. </p><p>Were any one to object and say, that it is the duty of parents to instruct their children in the fear and worship of God, and that therefore their discipline seems not to be confined to so short a time; to this the answer is, that this is indeed true, but the Apostle speaks here of domestic life, as we are wont commonly to speak of civil government; for though it belongs to magistrates to defend religion, yet we say that their office is confined to the limits of this life, for otherwise the civil and earthly government cannot be distinguished from the spiritual kingdom of Christ. </p><p>Moreover when God’s <em>chastisements </em>are said to be profitable to make men <em>partners of his holiness, </em>this is not to be so taken as though they made us really holy, but that they are helps to sanctify us, for by them the Lord exercises us in the work of mortifying the flesh. </p></div>
