<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>For the Lord your God. </em>Lest they should despise this teaching, he reminds them of God’s awful power; for the cause of contempt and negligence is, that the majesty of God does not always obtain its due reverence. Wherefore he inspires them with fear, to deter them from self-indulgence and indifference. </p></div>
