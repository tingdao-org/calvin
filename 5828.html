<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他为牛群中头生的，有威严。他的角是野牛的角，用以抵触万邦，直到地极。这角是以法莲的万万，玛拿西的千千。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>His glory is like the firstling. </em>Translators obscure the meaning by translating the word <em>firstling </em>in the nominative case. I have no doubt, however, but that he compares the glory of Joseph to the size of a very fine bullock, as if He had said, “His beauty is as of the most choice bullocks in his herds.” At least it is very consistent that the word <em>firstling </em>should be used for <em>pre-eminent. </em>He says, then, that no more magnificent or glorious bullocks should be found in the land of Joseph than the people itself would be. And to beauty he adds strength and vigor, so that they should be victorious over all their enemies. </p><p>At the end of the verse (as I have before stated,) he declares that what he had prophesied of Joseph should be common to the two families of Ephraim and Manasseh. At the same time he confirms the declaration of Jacob, whereby he had preferred Ephraim the younger to the elder. Manasseh, therefore, only reckons his thousands, but Ephraim his tell thousands, a proof of which fact God had given in the census which has been already recorded, in which the tribe of Ephraim was found to be the more numerous. </p></div>
