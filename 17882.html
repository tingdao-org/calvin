<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">玛得米那人躲避。基柄的居民逃遁。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Madmenah is removed. </em>In exaggerated language he describes that city to have been shaken to such a degree, as if it had been <em>removed </em>to another place. This relates to the disorderly movements of a people in flight; as if he had said that the inhabitants of that city were thrown into as great a commotion as if the city had been razed to its foundations. </p><p><em>The inhabitants of Gebim have gathered themselves. </em>This may be explained to mean that they are so terrified that they crowd together in a body. Others understand by it, that they rush out in a disorderly manner, as if there were not room for a free passage. </p></div>
