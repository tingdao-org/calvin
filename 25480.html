<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神却对他说，无知的人哪，今夜必要你的灵魂。你所预备的，要归谁呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Fool, this night they will demand thy soul from thee. </em>The word <em>soul </em>carries an allusion. Formerly, the <em>rich man </em>addressed his <em>soul </em>as the seat of all the affections: but now, he speaks of the life itself, or the vital spirit. The words, <em>they will demand, ( </em><span class="lang el-gr">ἀπαιτοῦσιν</span><em>) </em>though in the plural number, are used indefinitely, and mean nothing more than that the <em>life </em>of the <em>rich man, </em>which he imagined to be in his own power, was at the disposal of another. I advert to this, because some take occasion from them to make unfounded speculations about angels. The design of Christ is simply to show that the life of men, which they imagine to be strongly protected by the fortress of their riches, is every moment <span class="cite-ref">(272)</span> taken away. The <em>rich man </em>is thus convicted of folly, in not knowing that his life depended on another. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(272)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Que d’heure en heure la vie est ostee aux hommes</span>;” — “that from hour to hour the life of man is taken away.” </p></div></div>
