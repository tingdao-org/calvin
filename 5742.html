<div class="CUV verse">也使他们未曾晓得这律法的儿女得以听见，学习敬畏耶和华你们的神，在你们过约旦河要得为业之地，存活的日子，常常这样行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And that their children, which have not known anything. </em>Again, we see that their present assembly is not referred to, but that which was to be repeated every seven years, in order that their posterity might be retained in the path of duty. Another use, then, of this recitation is adduced; that many who, from their age, could not be witnesses of the first promulgation, might thence learn how God was to be served. The possession of the land is again set before them, that God’s bounty may attract them to obedience. </p></div>
