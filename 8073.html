<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚撒黑仍不肯转开。故此，押尼珥就用枪？？刺入他的肚腹，甚至枪从背后透出，亚撒黑就在那里仆倒而死。众人赶到亚撒黑仆倒而死的地方，就都站住。</div></div>
