<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神召我们，本不是要我们沾染污秽，乃是要我们成为圣洁。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>For God hath not called us</em>. This appears to be the same sentiment with the preceding one — that <em>the will of God is our sanctification</em>. There is, however, a little difference between them. For after having discoursed as to the correcting of the vices of the flesh, he proves, from the end of our calling, that God desires this. For he sets us apart to himself as his peculiar possession. <span class="cite-ref">(570)</span> Again, that God calls us to holiness, he proves by contraries, because he rescues us, and calls us back, from unchastity. From this he concludes, that all that reject this doctrine <em>reject not men, but God</em>, the Author of this calling, which altogether falls to the ground so soon as this principle as to newness of life is overthrown. Now, the reason why he rouses himself so vehemently is, because there are always wanton persons who, while they fearlessly despise God, treat with ridicule all threatenings of his judgment, and at the same time hold in derision all injunctions as to a holy and pious life. Such persons must not be taught, but must be beaten with severe reproofs as with the stroke of a hammer. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(570)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme pour son propre heritage et particulier</span>;” — “As for his peculiar and special inheritance.” </p></div></div>
