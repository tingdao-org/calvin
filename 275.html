<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">于是，耶和华使他们从那里分散在全地上。他们就停工，不造那城了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>So the Lord scattered them abroad</em>. Men had already been spread abroad; and this ought not to be regarded as a punishment, seeing it rather flowed from the benediction and grace of God. But those whom the Lord had before distributed with honor in various abodes, he now ignominiously scatters, driving them hither and thither like the members of a lacerated body. This, therefore, was not a simple dispersion for the replenishing of the earth, that it might every where have cultivators and inhabitants; but a violent rout, because the principal bond of conjunction between them was, cut asunder. </p></div>
