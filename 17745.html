<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">现在我告诉你们，我要向我葡萄园怎样行。我必撤去篱笆，使它被吞灭，拆毁墙垣，使它被践踏。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And now come, I will show you what I will do to my vineyard. </em>Having held the Jews to be condemned, as it were, by their own mouth, he next adds that he will take vengeance for their contempt of his grace, so that they will not escape from being punished. The reproof would not have been sufficiently powerful to affect their minds, if he had not also threatened punishment; and therefore he now declares that the heinous offense, of having wickedly imposed on him, will not escape vengeance. Now the punishment to be inflicted on them amounts to this, that they will be deprived of the gifts which they had abused, when God shall not only withdraw his care of them, but shall give them up to be plundered by their enemies. At the same time he shows how wretched their condition will be, when God shall have ceased to bestow on them his multiplied favors. </p><p>Hence it follows that it must have been owing entirely to the extraordinary goodness of God, that the <em>vineyard </em>remained safe and uninjured till that time. He goes so far as to point out the various supports by which it was upheld, and the vast resources which God possesses for destroying it both within and without; for when his protection has been removed, they must become a prey to all that pass by, whether men or beasts. “When the fence has been removed,” says he, “the cattle will tread on it and lay it bare, robbers will ransack and plunder it, and thus it will become a wilderness.” </p></div>
