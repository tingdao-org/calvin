<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在地上的万民中，必像打过的橄榄树，又像已摘的葡萄所剩无几。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>For it shall be in the midst of the land. </em>As this statement is inserted between the threatenings and the consolation, the Prophet appears to address the chosen people, and not all the nations indiscriminately; if we do not rather say that he describes the dispersion, by which the Jews were divided, as it were, into many nations. But this being a harsh and forced interpretation, I interpret it as simply meaning that some hope is left to the ruined nations, and certainly this prediction applies strictly to the kingdom of Christ; and therefore we need not wonder that some part of the salvation is also promised to the Gentiles. </p><p><em>As the shaking of an olive-tree. </em>The Prophet has elsewhere used the same metaphor, but it was when he spoke of the Church alone. (<span class="bvs">Isa_17:5</span>.) On that occasion he said that some seed of God would be left, that believers might not think that the Church was utterly ruined; for when “the olives are shaken,” still a few olives are left, and some grapes after the vintage; and in like manner, after the terrible destruction which shall fall upon the Church, a small number of the godly will be left. But now he extends the same promise to other parts of the world, as they were to become partakers of the same grace through Christ. Yet there is still a mixture of threatening; as if he had said, that the earth will be deprived of its inhabitants in exactly the same manner as the trees and vines are stripped of their fruits. </p></div>
