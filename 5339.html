<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你牛群羊群中头生的，凡是公的，都要分别为圣，归耶和华你的神。牛群中头生的，不可用它耕地。羊群中头生的，不可剪毛。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>All the firstling males. </em>Another caution is added, that they should make no profit of the first-born; for they might have used the labor of the ox in plowing, or as a beast of burden; they might also have sheared the lambs, and have afterwards brought a deteriorated animal into the tabernacle. God commands, therefore, that what was due to Him should be honestly and absolutely paid. But, if good laws sprang from evil habits, it hence appears with what audacious greediness men have ever been led away to wicked gains, since it was necessary that they should be prohibited by an express edict from seeking to enrich themselves at God’s expense. Wherefore, it is not to be wondered at that men are acute and sagacious in cheating each other, since they by no means hesitate to deceive God by wicked artifices. </p></div>
