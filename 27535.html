<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以他们中间多有相信的。又有希利尼尊贵的妇女，男子也不少。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>And many believed. </em>This is not referred unto the sentence next going before, as if those of whom he spake began to believe, making choice of some of them: for that were an absurd thing. But Luke’s meaning is, because many were added by their example, the Church was increased in that city. And hitherto hath Luke declared the first beginning of the church of Thessalonica, lest any man should think that Paul’s labors did perish through his sudden and violent departure; for unless I be much deceived, he showeth for this purpose what fruit his preaching brought forth in the other city, before he came to the exile of Berea.</p></div>
