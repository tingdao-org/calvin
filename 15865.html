<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，我真是你的仆人。我是你的仆人，是你婢女的儿子。你已经解开我的绑索。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16</strong><em>Come, O Jehovah! because I am thy servant. </em>As, in the former verse, he gloried that in him God had given an example of the paternal regard which he has for the faithful, so here he applies, in an especial manner, to himself the general doctrine, by declaring that his <em>fetters had been broken, </em>in consequence of his being included among the number of God’s servants. He employs the term<em>fetters, </em>as if one, with hands and feet bound, were dragged by the executioner. In assigning, as the reason of his deliverance, that he was God’s servant, he by no means vaunts of his services, but rather refers to God’s unconditional election; for we cannot make ourselves his servants, that being an honor conferred upon us solely by his adoption. Hence David affirms, that he was not God’s servant merely, but the <em>son of his handmaid. </em>“From the womb of my mother, even before I was born, was this honor conferred upon me.” He therefore presents himself as a common example to all who shall dedicate themselves to the service of God, and place themselves under his protection, that they may be under no apprehension for their safety while they have him for their defense. </p></div>
