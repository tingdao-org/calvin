<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">祭司长和差役看见他，就喊着说，钉他十字架，钉他十字架。彼拉多说，你们自己把他钉十字架吧。我查不出他有什么罪来。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Take you him. </em>He did not wish to deliver Christ into their hands, or to abandon him to their fury; only he declares that he will not be their executioner. This is evident from the reason immediately added, when he says that <em>he finds no guilt in him; </em>as if he had said, that he will never be persuaded to shed innocent blood for their gratification. That it is only the priests and officers who demand that he shall be crucified, is evident from the circumstance that the madness of the people was not so great, except so far as those bellows contributed afterwards to kindle it. </p></div>
