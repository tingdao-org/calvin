<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">两个孩子渐渐长大，以扫善于打猎，常在田野。雅各为人安静，常住在帐棚里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>And the boys grew</em>. Moses now briefly describes the manners of them both. He does not, indeed, commend Jacob on account of those rare and excellent qualities, which are especially worthy of praise and of remembrance, but only says that he was <em>simple</em>. The word <span class="lang he-il">תם</span> (<em>tam</em>,) although generally taken for <em>upright </em>and <em>sincere</em>, is here put antithetically. After the sacred writer has stated that Esau was robust, and addicted to hunting, he places on the opposite side the mild disposition of Jacob, who loved the quiet of home so much, that he might seem to be indolent; just as the Greeks call those persons <span class="lang el-gr">οἰκόσιτους</span><em>oikositous</em>, who, dwelling at home, give no evidence of their industry. In short, the comparison implies that Moses praises Esau on account of his vigor, but speaks of Jacob as being addicted to domestic leisure; and that he describes the disposition of the former as giving promise that he would be a courageous man, while the disposition of the latter had nothing worthy of commendation. Seeing that, by a decree of heaven, the honor of primogeniture would be transferred to Jacob, why did God suffer him to lie down in his tent, and to slumber among ashes; unless it be, that he sometimes intends his election to be concealed for a time, lest men should attribute something to their own preparatory acts? </p></div>
