<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">好叫我述说你一切的美德。我必在锡安城的门（城原文作女子），因你的救恩欢乐。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>That I may recount. </em>David’s meaning simply is, that he will celebrate the praises of God in all assemblies, and, wherever there is the greatest concourse of people, (for at that time it was the custom to hold assemblies at the gates of cities;) but, at the same time, there seems to be an allusion to the gates of death, of which he has just spoken, as if he had said, After I am delivered from the grave, I will do my endeavor to bear testimony, in the most public manner, to the goodness of God, manifested in my deliverance. As, however, it is not sufficient to utter the praises of God with our tongues, if they do not proceed from the heart, the Psalmist, in the last clause of the verse, expresses the inward joy with which he would engage in this exercise, <em>And that I may rejoice in thy salvation; </em>as if he had said, I desire to live in this world for no other purpose than to rejoice in having been preserved by the grace of God. Under the name of daughter, as is well known, the Jews meant a people or city, but he here names the city from its principal part, namely, Sion. </p></div>
