<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</div>
<div class="CUV verse">泉源从一个眼里能发出甜苦两样的水吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Doth a fountain</em>. He adduces these comparisons in order to shew that a cursing tongue is something monstrous, contrary to all nature, and subverts the order everywhere established by God. For God hath so arranged things which are contrary, that inanimate things ought to deter us from a chaotic mixture, sure as is found in a double tongue. <span class="cite-ref">(123)</span></p><p><strong>(123)</strong> There is a different reading at the end of the <span class="bvs">Jas_3:12</span>, adopted by <em>Griesbach</em>, though rejected by Mill and others: <span class="lang el-gr">οὕτως οὔτε ἁλυχὸν γλυχὺ ποιὢσαι ὕδωρ</span>, “So neither can salt water produce sweet.” This reading is favored by the <em>Syr. </em>and <em>Vulg.</em>, though the words are somewhat different. </p></div>
