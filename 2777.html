<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若向耶和华献初熟之物为素祭，要献上烘了的禾穗子，就是轧了的新穗子，当作初熟之物的素祭。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And if thou offer a meat-offering. </em>This offering is different from that of the first-fruits, since it was voluntary, whereas the first-fruits were paid in obedience to the enactment of the Law. But if any one chose to add anything to the first-fruits of his new corn, Moses lays down the rule, that the ears should be dried in the fire, so that they might be more easily pounded, and so might be burnt mixed with oil and frankincense; for so I interpret his words, that he means the same thing by “ears of corn dried by the fire,” and “corn beaten out of full ears.” He requires full ears, that the people may select them, and not offer anything poor or stunted. </p></div>
