<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人若说我认识他，却不遵守他的诫命，便是说谎话的。真理也不在他心里了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>He that saith, I know him </em>How does he prove that they are liars who boast that they have faith without piety? even by the contrary effect; for he has already said, that the knowledge of God is efficacious. For God is not known by a naked imagination, since he reveals himself inwardly to our hearts by the Spirit. Besides, as many hypocrites vainly boast that they have faith, the Apostle charges all such with falsehood; for what he says would be superfluous, were there no false and vain profession of Christianity made by man. </p></div>
