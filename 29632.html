<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11</strong><em>Exhort</em>. It is the same word that we had in the close of the preceding chapter, and which we rendered <em>comfort</em>, because the context required it, and the same would not suit ill with this passage also. For what he has treated of previously furnishes matter of both — of <em>consolation </em>as well as of <em>exhortation</em>. He bids them, therefore, communicate to one another what has been given them by the Lord. He adds, that they may <em>edify one another </em>— that is, may confirm each other in that doctrine. Lest, however, it might seem as if he reproved them for carelessness, he says at the same time that they of their own accord did what he enjoins. But, as we are slow to what is good, those that are the most favourably inclined of all, have always, nevertheless, need to be stimulated. </p></div>
