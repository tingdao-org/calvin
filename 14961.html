<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25</strong><em>Let their habitation be desolate. </em>Here he proceeds farther than in the preceding verse, praying that God would cause his wrath to descend to their posterity; and it is no new thing for the sins of the fathers to be cast into the bosom of the children. As David uttered these imprecations by the inspiration and influence of the Holy Spirit, so he took them out of the law itself, in which God threatens that he will </p><p>“visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him,” (<span class="bvs">Exo_20:5</span>) </p><p>In this way he desires that the memorial of them may be cursed, and that thus God would not spare them even after their death. </p></div>
