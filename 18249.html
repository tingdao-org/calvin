<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚述人必因耶和华的声音惊惶。耶和华必用杖击打他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>Surely by the voice of Jehovah. </em>He added this for two reasons; first, to shew why the Assyrian must be bruised; for, since he was cruel and savage to others, it is proper that </p><p>“the same measure which he meted should be measured to him again.” (<span class="bvs">Mat_7:2</span>.) </p><p>This is the ordinary judgment of God against tyrants, as the Prophet says in a subsequent passage of this book, </p><p>“Woe to thee that spoilest, for thou shalt be spoiled.” (<span class="bvs">Isa_33:1</span>.) </p><p>The second reason is, because the power of the Assyrian king appeared to be so great that he could not fall. Although, therefore, he was fortified on every hand, not only to defend himself, but also to attack others, yet the Prophet says, that “by the voice of God” alone he shall be bruised. Hence we learn how groundless is the confidence of wicked men, who rely on their garrisons and arms, and presumptuously despise God, as if they had not been liable to his judgment. But in order to destroy them, the Lord will have no need of any other arms than his own “voice;” for by the slightest expression of his will he will lay them low. Nor can it be doubted that the Prophet intends to withdraw the minds of believers from earthly means, that they may not inquire how it shall be done, but may be satisfied with the bare promise of God, who is fully able to execute his word as soon as it has gone forth from him. </p></div>
