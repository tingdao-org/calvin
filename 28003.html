<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">都是偏离正路，一同变为无用。没有行善的，连一个也没有。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong>It is added, <span class="cite-ref">(99)</span><em>There is no one who doeth kindness </em>By this we are to understand, that they had put off every feeling of humanity. For as the best bond of mutual concord among us is the knowledge of God, (as he is the common Father of all, he wonderfully unites us, and without him there is nothing but disunion,) so inhumanity commonly follows where there is ignorance of God, as every one, when he despises others, loves and seeks his own good. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(99)</span> This verse is literally the <em>Septuagint, </em>and as to meaning, a correct version of the Hebrew. “All have gone out of the way<span class="lang el-gr">— πάντες ἐξέκλιναν”</span> “is in Hebrew <span class="lang he-il">הכל סר</span>, “the whole (or every one) has turned aside,” or revolted, or apostatized. Then, “they have become unprofitable” or useless, is <span class="lang he-il">נאלחו</span>, “they are become putrid,” or Corrupted, like putrified fruit or meat, therefore useless, not fit for what they were designed — to serve God and to promote their own and the good of others. Idolatry was evidently this putrescence. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
