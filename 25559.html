<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">便对他们说，你们中间谁有驴或有牛，在安息日掉在井里，不立时拉他上来呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>Which of you shall have an ox or an ass? </em>Though they did not deserve that Christ should take pains to remove the offense, yet he shows that he did nothing inconsistent with the observance of the Sabbath. And this he undoubtedly does, not so much with the view of instructing them, as of protecting himself against their slanders; for he knew that they were too much blinded by virulent hatred to yield submissively, to argument, but wished to triumph over their malice, by compelling them through shame to be silent. If we are at liberty to relieve brute animals on Sabbath, it would be unreasonable that we should not perform a similar office of kindness to man, who is formed after the image of God. </p></div>
