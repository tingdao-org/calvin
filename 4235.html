<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">给以色列人作纪念，使亚伦后裔之外的人不得近前来在耶和华面前烧香，免得他遭可拉和他一党所遭的。这乃是照耶和华借着摩西所吩咐的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>To be a memorial unto the children of Israel. </em>This passage again confirms what I have just said, that God’s judgments, which ought to remain in full remembrance in every age, straightway escape, and are blotted out front men’s minds, unless they are provided with certain aids to meditate upon them. This, however, does not happen so much from ignorance as neglect. Wherefore we ought to be the more attentive to the aids to memory, which may retain us in the path of duty. </p></div>
