<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以色列人从埃及所带来约瑟的骸骨，葬埋在示剑，就是在雅各从前用一百块银子向示剑的父亲，哈抹的子孙所买的那块地里。这就作了约瑟子孙的产业。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>32.</strong><em>And the bones of Joseph, </em>etc The time when the bones of Joseph were buried is not mentioned; but it is easy to infer that the Israelites had performed this duty after they obtained a peaceful habitation in the city of Shechem. For although he had not designated a particular place for a sepulchre, they thought it a mark of respect to deposit his bones in the field which Jacob had purchased. It may be, however, that this is expressed as a censure on the sluggishness of the people, to which it was owing, that Joseph could not be buried with Abraham, that locality being still in the power of the enemy. Stephen (<span class="bvs">Act_7:0</span>) mentions the bones of the twelve patriarchs, and it is not impossible that the other tribes, from feelings of emulation, gathered together the ashes of their progenitors. It is there said that the field was purchased by Abraham; but obviously an error in the name has crept in. With regard to sepulture, we must hold in general, that the very frequent mention of it in Scripture is owing to its being a symbol of the future Resurrection. </p><p>END OF THE COMMENTARY ON THE BOOK<LineBreak />OF JOSHUA. </p></div>
