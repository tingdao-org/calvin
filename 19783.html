<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我也要使犹大被掳的和以色列被掳的归回，并建立他们和起初一样。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>By the word <em>building, </em>God means that they would return to their own country for this end — that they might remain secure in it. And this promise was very needful, since the Jews were on every side surrounded by enemies; for all their neighbors had united together against them, and were most hostile, so that they never ceased to create new troubles. For this reason mention is made of <em>building, </em>as though the Prophet had said, that the prosperity of the city would be lasting, for it would be so founded, that it would not fall or totter at any kind of assault. </p><p>But he promises deliverance, not only to the tribe of Judah, but also to the whole kingdom of Israel. Though very few returned, yet God offered the benefit which he had promised to all in common: and then, as it has been often said, this promise is to be extended to the coming of Christ. For God confined not his favor to those few years in which liberty was granted to the Jews, when they returned from their exile in Babylon; but included the eternal salvation which remained for them, of whiclx the prelude was their return. Let us now proceed, — </p></div>
