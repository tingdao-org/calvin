<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>You are of more value </em>This is true in general of all men, for the <em>sparrows </em>were created for their advantage. But this discourse relates peculiarly to the sons of God, who possess a far higher right than what they derive from creation. Now the rank which belongs to men arises solely from the undeserved kindness of God. </p></div>
