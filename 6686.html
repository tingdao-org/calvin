<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约阿施回答站着攻击他的众人说，你们是为巴力争论吗？你们要救他吗？谁为他争论，趁早将谁治死。巴力若果是神，有人拆毁他的坛，让他为自己争论吧。</div></div>
