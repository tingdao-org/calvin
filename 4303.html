<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">凡摸了人死尸，不洁净自己的，就玷污了耶和华的帐幕，这人必从以色列中剪除。因为那除污秽的水没有洒在他身上，他就为不洁净，污秽还在他身上。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Whosoever toucheth the dead body. </em>The severity of. the capital punishment shews how very pleasing to God is purity. If any one bad forgotten to sprinkle himself on the third or the seventh day, he might redeem his negligence by a prolongation of the term, because he only postponed his purification to another day; but it was a capital crime to enter the sanctuary in his uncleanness, since thus holy and profane things would be mixed together, nay, the altar would have been polluted as well as the whole service of God. But indeed the act of touching a dead body was of slight importance, nor was it to be deemed an atrocious crime; but here the external defilement is not regarded in itself, as if God were wroth on account of a stain contracted by the performance of a pious duty. <span class="cite-ref">(25)</span> Rather must the object of the <em>ceremony </em>be considered, for God designed by these rudiments to teach the Israelites, like children, that if any one should pollute sacred things by his impurity, he would by no means be tolerated in this audacity. In this then consisted the religious import of the transaction, that the worship of God was too precious for the Israelites to be permitted to contaminate it with impunity. Whence we gather that the punishment was denounced as against sacrilege. In sum, it comes to this, that God is not duly worshipped except with a sincere heart and pure hands; and that if any pollution be contracted<em>, </em>there is need of expiation before a free access is re-opened to holy things. But it must be remarked as to the contact, that it was accounted the same thing, whether the corpse lay in a field or a house; whilst, if any one died in a tent, men were polluted by merely entering it, and likewise vessels without covers thus became unclean. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(25)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour ensevelir son pere</span>;” by burying his father — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
