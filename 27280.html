<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">于是彼得下去见那些人，说，我就是你们所找的人。你们来是为什么缘故。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Behold, I am he whom ye seek. </em>Luke declareth now how ready Peter was to obey; secondly, that he understood at length, by the messengers, to what end the vision was showed unto him. For he heareth that he is called by Cornelius, a man that is a Gentile, whom he would have counted profane, and unworthy of his company, unless his judgment had been corrected with this voice, “That which God calleth pure, judge not thou to be common.” This is to be wise indeed, when as abandoning all vain confidence, and correcting our stubbornness, the authority of God doth so pull us unto it, and doth so possess our minds, that we count nothing right but that which it prescribeth. </p></div>
