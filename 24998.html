<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>And that they might offer a sacrifice </em>This <em>sacrifice </em>belonged to the ceremony of purification; lest any one should suppose that it was offered for the sake of redeeming the first-born. When the Evangelist mentions <em>a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, </em>he takes for granted that his readers will understand, that Joseph and Mary were in such deep poverty, as not to have it in their power to offer a lamb. For this exception is expressly mentioned: </p><p>“If she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall <LineBreak />bring two turtles, or two young pigeons,” (<span class="bvs">Lev_12:8</span>.) </p><p>Is it objected, that the Magi had very recently supplied them with a sufficiency of gold to make the purchase? I reply: We must not imagine that they had such abundance of gold as to raise them suddenly from poverty to wealth. We do not read, that their camels were laden with gold. It is more probable that it was some small present, which they had brought solely as a mark of respect. The law did not rigorously enjoin, that the poor should spend their substance on a sacrifice, but drew a line of distinction between them and the rich, as to the kind of sacrifices, and thus relieved them from burdensome expense. There would be no impropriety in saying, that Joseph and Mary gave as much as their circumstances allowed, though they reserved a little money to defray the expenses of their journey and of their household. </p></div>
