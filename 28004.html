<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们的喉咙是敞开的坟墓。他们用舌头弄诡诈。嘴唇里有虺蛇的毒气。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong>It is further added, <em>Their throat is an open grave; </em><span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> that is, a gulf to swallow up men. It is more than if he had said, that they were devourers (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀνθρωποφάγους</span> — men-eaters;) for it is an intimation of extreme barbarity, when the throat is said to be so great a gulf, that it is sufficient to swallow down and devour men whole and entire. Their<em>tongues are deceitful, </em>and, <em>the poison of asps is under their lips, </em>import the same thing, </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> This is from <span class="bvs">Psa_5:9</span>, that is, the first part, and is literally the <em>Septuagint, </em>which correctly represents the Hebrew. The last clause is from <span class="bvs">Psa_140:3</span>, and is according to the <em>Septuagint, </em>and the Hebrew, too, except that “asps,” or adders, is in the singular number. [<span class="bvs">Stuart </span>] gives the import of this figurative language different from [<span class="bvs">Calvin </span>] <em>: </em>“As from the sepulchre,” he says, “issues forth an offensive and pestilential vapor; so from the mouths of slanderous persons issue noisome and pestilential words. Their words are like poison, they utter the poisonous breath of slander.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
