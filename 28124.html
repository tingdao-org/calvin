<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>They then who are in the flesh, etc. </em>It is not without reason that I have rendered the adversative <span class="lang el-gr">δὲ</span> as an illative: for the Apostle infers from what had been said, that those who give themselves up to be guided by the lusts of the flesh, are all of them abominable before God; and he has thus far confirmed this truth, — that all who walk not after the Spirit are alienated from Christ, for they are without any spiritual life. </p></div>
