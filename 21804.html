<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你既看见非人手凿出来的一块石头从山而出，打碎金，银，铜，铁，泥，那就是至大的神把后来必有的事给王指明。这梦准是这样，这讲解也是确实的。</div></div>
