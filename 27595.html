<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这样有两年之久，叫一切住在亚西亚的，无论是犹太人，是希利尼人，都听见主的道。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>All which dwelt. </em>Luke doth not mean that the men of Asia came thither to hear Paul; but that the smell [savor] of his preaching went throughout all Asia, and that the seed was sown far and wide; so that his labor was fruitful not only to one city, but also to places which were far off; and that cometh to pass oftentimes, that when the truth of God is preached in one place, it soundeth where the voice of the minister cannot sound, being spread abroad far and wide; because it is delivered from hand to hand, and one doth teach another. For one man were not sufficient, unless every man were for himself diligent to spread abroad the faith.</p></div>
