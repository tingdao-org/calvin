<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他埋伏在暗地，如狮子蹲在洞中。他埋伏，要掳去困苦人。他拉网，就把困苦人掳去。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>In the next verse, he sets forth their cruelty in a light still more aggravated, by another comparison, saying, that they thirst for their prey <em>like lions in their dens </em>Now, it is a step higher in wickedness to equal in cruelty wild beasts than to make havoc after the manner of robbers. It is worthy of remark, that he always joins deceits and snares with violence, in order the better to show how miserable the children of God would be, unless they were succoured by help from heaven. There is also added another similitude, which expresses more clearly how craft in catching victims is mingled with cruelty. <em>They catch them, </em>says he but it is by <em>drawing them into their net </em>By these words he means, that they not only rush upon them with open force and violence, but that, at the same time also, they spread their nets in order to deceive. </p></div>
