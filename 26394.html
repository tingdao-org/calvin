<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>The Pharisees therefore said. </em>They adduce as an objection what is commonly said, that no man ought to be trusted, when speaking in his own cause. For a <em>true testimony </em>is put for “what is lawful and worthy of credit.” In short, they mean that it is of no use for him to speak, unless he bring proof from some other quarter. </p></div>
