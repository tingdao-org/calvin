<div class="CUV verse">我说这话，是羞辱自己。好像我们从前是软弱的。然而人在何事上勇敢，（我说句愚妄话）我也勇敢。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Nay, in whatsoever. </em>Paul had asked, why the Corinthians showed more respect to others than to him, while he had not been by any means weak, that is, contemptible. He now confirms this, because, if a comparison had been entered upon, he would not have been inferior to any one in any department of honor. </p></div>
