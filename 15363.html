<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他的后裔要存到永远，他的宝座在我面前，如日之恒一般。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>His seed shall endure for ever. </em>There now follows the promise that the right of sovereignty shall always remain with the posterity of David. These two things — his offspring and his throne, are conjoined; and by these words the everlasting duration of the kingdom is promised, so that it should never pass to those who were of a strange and different race. The sun and the moon are produced as witnesses; for although they are creatures subject to corruption, they yet possess more stability than the earth or air; the elements, as we see, being subject to continual changes. As the whole of this lower world is subject to unceasing agitation and change, there is presented to us a more steadfast state of things in the sun and moon, that the kingdom of David might not be estimated according to the common order of nature. Since, however, this royal throne was shaken in the time of Rehoboam, as we have before had occasion to remark, and afterwards broken down and overthrown, it follows that this prophecy cannot be limited to David. For although at length the outward majesty of this kingdom was put an end to without hope of being re-established, the sun ceased not to shine by day, nor the moon by night. Accordingly, until we come to Christ, God might seem to be unfaithful to his promises. But in the branch which sprung from the root of Jesse, these words were fulfilled in their fullest sense. <span class="cite-ref">(552)</span></p><p><strong>(552)</strong> “<em>Once</em>. Emphatic.
