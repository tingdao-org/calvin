<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things that that of Abel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并新约的中保耶稣，以及所洒的血。这血所说的比亚伯的血所说的更美。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>And to Jesus the Mediator, etc. </em>He adds this in the last place, because it is he alone through whom the Father is reconciled to us, and who renders his face serene and lovely to us, so that we may come to him without fear. At the same time he shows how Christ becomes our Mediator, even through his own <em>blood, </em>which after the Hebrew mode of speaking he calls the blood of <em>sprinkling, </em>which means sprinkled blood; for as it was once for all shed to make an atonement for us, so our souls must be now cleansed by it through faith. At the same time the Apostle alludes to the ancient rite of the Law, which has been before mentioned. </p><p><em>That speaketh better things, etc. </em>There is no reason why <em>better </em>may not be rendered adverbially in the following manner, — “Christ’s blood cries more efficaciously, and is better heard by God than the blood of Abel.” It is, however, preferable to take the words literally: the blood of Christ is said to speak <em>better things</em>, because it avails to obtain pardon for our sins. The <em>blood of Abel </em>did not properly cry out; for it was his murder that called for vengeance before God. But the blood of Christ cries out, and the atonement made by it is heard daily. <span class="cite-ref">(268)</span></p><p><strong>(268)</strong> See Appendix X 2. </p></div>
