<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>We will not conceal them from their children in the generation to come. </em>Some take the verb <span class="lang he-il">נכחד</span>, <em>nechached, </em>in the <em>nephil </em>conjugation, and translate it, <em>they are not concealed or hidden. </em>But it ought, according to the rules of grammar, to be resolved thus: — <em>We will not conceal them from our posterity, </em>implying, that what we have been taught by our ancestors we should endeavor to transmit to their children. By this means, all pretense of ignorance is removed; for it was the will of God that these things should be published from age to age without interruption; so that being transmitted from father to child in each family, they might reach even the last family of man. The end for which this was to be done is shown — that <em>they might celebrate the praises of Jehovah, in the wonderful works which he hath done </em></p></div>
