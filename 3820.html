<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">叫她喝了以后，她若被玷污，得罪了丈夫，这致咒诅的水必进入她里面变苦了，她的肚腹就要发胀，大腿就要消瘦，那妇人便要在他民中被人咒诅。</div></div>
