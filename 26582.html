<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>There therefore they made him a banquet</em>. Matthew (<span class="bvs">Mat_26:7</span>) and Mark, (<span class="bvs">Mar_14:3</span>) say that he then supped at the house of Simon the leper. John does not mention the house, but shows plainly enough, that it was in some other place than the house of Lazarus and Martha that he supped; for he says that <em>Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with him</em>, that is, one who had been invited along with Christ. Nor does it involve any contradiction, that Matthew and Mark relate that the <em>head </em>of Christ was anointed, while John relates that his <em>feet </em>were anointed. The usual practice was the anointing of <em>the head</em>, and on this account Pliny reckons it an instance of excessive luxury, that some anointed the ankles. The three Evangelists agree in this; that Mary did not anoint Christ sparingly, but poured on him a large quantity of ointment. What John speaks, about <em>the feet</em>, amounts to this, that the whole body of Christ, down to the feet, was anointed. There is an amplification in the word <em>feet</em>, which appears more fully from what follows, when he adds, that Mary <em>wiped his feet with her hair </em></p></div>
