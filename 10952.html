<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大卫祷告神说，吩咐数点百姓的不是我吗？我犯了罪，行了恶，但这群羊作了什么呢？愿耶和华我神的手攻击我和我的父家，不要攻击你的民，降瘟疫与他们。</div></div>
