<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">然后要对我的灵魂说，灵魂哪，你有许多财物积存，可作多年的费用。只管安安逸逸的吃喝快乐吧。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>Take thine ease, eat, drink, enjoy thyself. </em>When he exhorts himself to <em>eat and drink, </em>he no longer remembers that he is a man, but swells into pride by relying on his abundance. We daily perceive striking instances of this disdainful conduct <span class="cite-ref">(270)</span> in irreligious men, who hold up the mass of their riches, as if it were nothing less than a brazen rampart against death. When he says, <em>Eat, my soul, and enjoy thyself, </em>there is an emphatic meaning in this Hebrew idiom; <span class="cite-ref">(271)</span> for he addresses himself in such a manner as to imply, that he has all that is necessary for gratifying all his senses and all his desires. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(270)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’une telle mecognoissance et fierte</span>;” — “of such ingratitude and pride.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(271)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En ceste locution Hebraique il y a une vehemence et proprie plus que les mots n’emportent de prime face</span>;” — “in that Hebrew form of expression there is greater force and propriety than the words at first sight bear.” </p></div></div>
