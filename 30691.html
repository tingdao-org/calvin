<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们曾对你们说过，末世必有好讥诮的人，随从自己不敬虔的私欲而行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>By <em>the last time </em>he means that in which the renewed condition of the Church received a fixed form till the end of the world; and it began at the first coming of Christ. </p><p>After the usual manner of Scripture, he calls them scoffers who, being inebriated with a profane and impious contempt of God, rush headlong into a brutal contempt of the Divine Being, so that no fear nor reverence keeps them any longer within the limits of duty: as no dread of a future judgment exists in their hearts, so no hope of eternal life. So at this day the world is full of Epicurean despisers of God, who having cast off every fear, madly scoff at the whole doctrine of true religion, regarding it as fabulous. </p></div>
