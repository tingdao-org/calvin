<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>For he hath not despised. </em>To rejoice in one another’s good, and to give thanks in common for each other’s welfare, is a branch of that communion which ought to exist among the people of God, as Paul also teaches, </p><p>“That for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.” <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">2Co_1:11</span>,) </p><p>But this statement of David serves another important purpose — it serves to encourage every man to hope that God will exercise the same mercy towards himself. By the way, we are taught from these words that the people of God ought to endure their afflictions patiently, however long it shall please the Lord to keep them in a state of distress, that he may at length succor them, and lend them his aid when they are so severely tried. </p></div>
