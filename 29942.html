<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>I give thanks to my God</em>. It deserves attention, that he at the same time prays for that very thing for which he “gives thanks.” Even the most perfect, so long as they live in the world, never have so good ground for congratulation as not to need prayers, that God may grant to them, not only to persevere till the end, but likewise to make progress from day to day. </p></div>
