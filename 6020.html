<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">艾城和伯特利城没有一人不出来追赶以色列人的，撇了敞开的城门，去追赶以色列人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And there was not a man left in Ai, </em>etc It will be clear from the context that some were taken in the city and slain, and therefore we must hold that the sally was not by all universally, and that the old men and women and many others unfit for war, did not rush forth into the fields; the meaning simply is, that no garrison was left to defend the city. The same thing is said of Bethel, and hence we may easily conjecture that Bethel, as it was a small unimportant town, belonged to another power. The inhabitants, however, from being unable to defend their own city, abandoned it, and offered their whole force to the king of Ai, to whom they were perhaps tributaries. It is uncertain whether they went to the king of Ai before the arrival of the Israelites, to unite their forces with his in the contest, but the probability is, that as they were unable to resist they had come by agreement into a fortified and more populous city. They thought that they could not, possibly be safe unless they were preserved under the shadow of a neighboring city superior to their own. </p></div>
