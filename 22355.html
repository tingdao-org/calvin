<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">四围的列国阿，你们要速速地来，一同聚集。耶和华阿，求你使你的大能者降临。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>At length he concludes, <em>There will Jehovah overthrow thy mighty ones. </em>Though the Prophet uses the singular number, “<em>thy </em>”, he no doubt refers to the whole earth; as though he said, “Whatever enemies there may be to my people, I will cut them down, however strong they may be.” We now perceive that everything the Prophet has hitherto said has been for this end — to show, that God takes care of the safety of his Church, even in its heaviest afflictions, and that he will be the avenger of wrongs, after having for a time tried the patience of his people and chastised their faults — that there will be a turn in the state of things, so that the condition of the Church will be ever more desirable, even under its greatest evils, than of those whom the Lord bears with and indulges, and on whom he does not so quickly take vengeance. </p></div>
