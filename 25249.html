<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">又有希律的家宰苦撒的妻子约亚拿，并苏撒拿，和好些别的妇女，都是用自己的财物供给耶稣和门徒。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_8:3</span><strong>.</strong><em>Joanna, the wife of Chuza </em>It is uncertain whether or not Luke intended his statement to be applied to those women in the same manner as to Mary To me it appears probable that she is placed first in order, as a person in whom Christ had given a signal display of his power; and that <em>the wife of Chuza, and Susanna, </em>matrons of respectability and of spotless reputation, are mentioned afterwards, because they had only been cured of ordinary diseases. Those matrons being wealthy and of high rank, it reflects higher commendation on their pious zeal, that they supply Christ’s expenses out of their own property, and, not satisfied with so doing, leave the care of their household affairs, and choose to follow him, attended by reproach and many other inconveniences, through various and uncertain habitations, instead of living quietly and at ease in their own houses. It is even possible, that <em>Chuza, Herod’s steward, </em>being too like his master, was strongly opposed to what his wife did in this matter, but that the pious woman overcame this opposition by the ardor and constancy of her zeal. </p></div>
