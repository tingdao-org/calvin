<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们因着信，过红海如行干地。埃及人试着要过去，就被吞灭了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>By faith they passed, etc. </em>It is certain, that many in that multitude were unbelieving; but the Lord granted to the faith of a few, that the whole multitude should pass through the Red Sea dry­shod. But in doing the same thing, there was a great difference between the Israelites and the Egyptians; while the former passed through safely, the latter coming after them were drowned. Whence was this difference, but that the Israelites had the word of God, and that the Egyptians were without it. The argument then derives its force from what happened to the contrary; hence, he says, that the <em>Egyptians were drowned. </em>That disastrous event was the punishment of their temerity, as on the other hand, the Israelites were preserved safe, because they relied on God’s word, and refused not to march through the midst of the waters. </p></div>
