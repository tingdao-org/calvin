<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们的帐棚和羊群都要夺去，将幔子和一切器皿，并骆驼为自己掠去。人向他们喊着说，四围都有惊吓。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet, in speaking of tents and curtains, had regard to the way of living adopted by that nation; for the Arabs, we know, dwelt in cabins and tents, as they do at this day, and they were also shepherds. They had no cultivated fields, but led their flocks through the deserts; and they had a great number of camels. This is the reason why the Prophet mentions <em>tents, curtains, camels, and flocks</em>, while speaking of the Kedareans; for they dwelt not in a fertile country, they possessed no arable lands, nor had they much other wealth, neither cities nor palaces. The sum of what is said is, that the Kedareans were doomed to destruction, and were therefore exposed as a prey to their enemies. </p><p>But as this was difficult to be believed, he adds, <em>They shall cry to them, Terror on every side </em>By these words the Prophet means, that there would be so much dread, that all would suffer their possessions to be plundered, not daring to make any resistance, because terror on every side would lay hold on them. They who read, “They shall call them terror on every side,” think that this is said metaphorically of the soldiers, as they were terrible. Some also say, “The king of Babylon shall call” or summon “terror on every side against them.” But the former explanation is the most probable, that when enemies called or cried out, <em>Terror, terror</em>, as conquerors, they would overcome them by their voice alone. This is, as I think, the real meaning of the Prophet. It now follows, — </p></div>
