<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们要吃无酵饼七日。头一日要把酵从你们各家中除去，因为从头一日起，到第七日为止，凡吃有酵之饼的，必从以色列中剪除。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>Whosoever eateth leavened bread. </em>This law specially refers to the keeping of the Passover. God had before forbidden the use of leaven; and He now enacts the punishment to be inflicted, if any should neglect the prohibition, and mingle leaven with the Paschal feast. But it is not without reason that we have postponed to this place what Moses has joined together with the institution of the Passover; for the plan proposed by us demands that the political laws, which sanction God’s worship by the denunciation of punishments, should occupy their peculiar place. From the punishment it appears that, although it may be in itself a trifling matter to abstain from leaven, (as Paul teaches that “bodily exercise profiteth little,” <span class="bvs">1Ti_4:8</span>,) yet, inasmuch as in this ceremony the redemption of the people was kept in memory, it was a very gross crime not to observe whatever God had prescribed, for we must estimate the importance of the rites of the law from their object. <span class="cite-ref">(69)</span></p><p><strong>(69)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Selon leur fin, et leur verite</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div>
