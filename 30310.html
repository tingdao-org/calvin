<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这样信心若没有行为就是死的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>Is dead, being alone</em>. He says that faith is dead, being by itself, that is, when destitute of good works. We hence conclude that it is indeed no faith, for when dead, it does not properly retain the name. The Sophists plead this expression and say, that some sort of faith is found by itself; but this frivolous caviling is easily refuted; for it is sufficiently evident that the Apostle reasons from what is impossible, as Paul calls an angel anathema, if he attempted to subvert the gospel. (<span class="bvs">Gal_1:8</span>.) </p></div>
