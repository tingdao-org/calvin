<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">惟有义人必然欢喜，在神面前高兴快乐。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3</strong><em>But the righteous shall be glad </em>It is here intimated by David, that when God shows himself formidable to the wicked, this is with the design of securing the deliverance of his Church. He would seem indirectly to contrast the joy of which he now speaks with the depression and grief felt by well affected men under the reign of Saul — suggesting, that God succeeds a season of temporary trouble with returns of comfort, to prevent his people from being overwhelmed by despondency. He leaves us also to infer, that one reason of that joy which they experience is derived from knowing that God is propitious to them, and interests himself in their safety. The Hebrew words, <span class="lang he-il">מפני</span>, <em>mipne, </em>and <span class="lang he-il">לפני</span>, <em>liphne, </em>admit of the same meaning; but I think that the Psalmist intended to note a distinction. The wicked flee from the presence of God, as what inspires them with terror; the righteous again rejoice in it, because nothing delights them more than to think that God is near them. When commenting upon the passage, <span class="bvs">Psa_18:26</span>, we saw why the Divine presence terrifies some and comforts others; for “with the pure he will show himself pure, and with the froward he will show himself froward.” One expression is heaped by the Psalmist upon another, to show how great the joy of the Lord’s people is, and how entirely it possesses and occupies their affections. </p></div>
