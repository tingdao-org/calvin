<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人若不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干，人拾起来，扔在火里烧了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>If any one abide not in me. </em>He again lays before them the punishment of ingratitude, and, by doing so, excites and urges them to perseverance. It is indeed the gift of God, but the exhortation to fear is not uncalled for, lest our flesh, through too great indulgence, should root us out. </p><p><em>He is cast out, and withered, like a branch. </em>Those who are cut off from Christ are said to <em>wither </em>like a dead branch; because, as the commencement of strength is from him, so also is its uninterrupted continuance. Not that it ever happens that any one of the elect is dried up, but because there are many hypocrites who, in outward appearance, flourish and are green for a time, but who afterwards, when they ought to yield fruit, show the very opposite of that which the Lord expects and demands from his people. <span class="cite-ref">(81)</span></p><p><strong>(81)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Lesquels puls apres quand il faut rendre le fruict, monstrent tout le contraire de ce que le Seigneur attend et requicrt des siens</span>.” </p></div>
