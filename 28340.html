<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>To whom not only I, etc. </em>As Prisca and Aquila had not spared their life for preserving the life of Paul, he testifies that he himself was individually thankful to them: he however adds, that thanks were given them by all the Churches of Christ; and he added this that he might, by such an example, influence the Romans. And deservedly dear and precious to all the Gentiles was the life of such a man, as it was an incomparable treasure: it was therefore no wonder that all the Churches of the Gentiles thought themselves to be under obligations to his preservers. <span class="cite-ref">(472)</span></p><p>What he adds respecting the Church in their house is worthy of being observed; for he could not have more splendidly adorned their household than by giving it the title of a Church. The word <em>congregation, </em>which [<span class="bvs">Erasmus </span>] has adopted, I do not approve; for it is plainly evident, that Paul, by way of honor, had used the sacred name of Church. <span class="cite-ref">(473)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(472)</span> The occasion is not mentioned. It was probably at Corinth, according to the account given in <span class="bvs">Act_18:0</span>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(473)</span> Some of the Fathers considered that the family, being all religious, was the Church; but this is wholly inconsistent with the mode of expression that is used, and with the state of things at that time. They had no churches or temples to meet in; private houses were their churches. Superstitious ideas as to places of worship no doubt led men to seek such following, if he meant only the family, — “Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with (<span class="lang el-gr">σὺν </span> — together with) the Church that is in their house,” <span class="bvs">1Co_16:19</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
