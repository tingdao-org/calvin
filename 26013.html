<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但我们素来所盼望要赎以色列民的就是他。不但如此，而且这事成就，现在已经三天了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>But we hoped. </em>From what follows it is evident that the hope which they had entertained respecting Christ was not broken off, though at first sight such might appear to be the import of their words. But as a person who had received no previous instruction in the Gospel might be apt to be prejudiced by the narrative which he was about to give respecting the condemnation of Christ, that he was condemned by <em>the rulers </em>of the Church, <em>Cleopas </em>meets this offense by <em>the hope of redemption. </em>And though he afterwards shows that it is with trembling and hesitation that he continues in this hope, yet he industriously collects all that can contribute to its support. For it is probable that he mentions the third day for no other reason than that the Lord had promised that after three days he would rise again. When he afterwards relates that <em>the women had not fouled the body, and that they tad seen a vision of angels, </em>and that what the women had said about the empty grave was likewise confirmed by the testimony of the men, the whole amounts to this, that Christ had risen. Thus the holy man, hesitating between faith and fear, employs what is adapted to nourish faith, and struggles against fear to the utmost of his power. </p></div>
