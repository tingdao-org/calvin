<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神和亚伯拉罕说完了话，就离开他上升去了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>God went up from Abraham </em>This expression contains a profitable doctrine, namely, that Abraham certainly knew this vision to be from God; for the ascent here spoken implies as much. And it is necessary for the pious to be fully assured that what they hear proceeds from God, in order that they may not be carried hither and thither but may depend alone upon heaven. And whereas God now, when he has spoken to us, does not openly ascend to heaven before our eyes; this ought to diminish nothing from the certainty of our faith; because a full manifestation of Him has been made in Christ, with which it is right that we should be satisfied. Besides, although God does not daily ascend upwards in a visible form, yet, in this his majesty is not less resplendent, that he raises us upwards by transforming us into his own image. Further, he gives sufficient authority to his word, when he seals it upon our hearts by his spirit. </p></div>
