<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to enquire by."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚哈斯王吩咐祭司乌利亚说，早晨的燔祭，晚上的素祭，王的燔祭，素祭，国内众民的燔祭，素祭，奠祭都要烧在大坛上。燔祭牲和平安祭牲的血也要洒在这坛上，只是铜坛我要用以求问耶和华。</div></div>
