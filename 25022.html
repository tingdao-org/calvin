<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>And his mother said to him </em>Those who think that the holy virgin spake in this manner, for the purpose of showing her authority, are, in my opinion, mistaken. It is even possible, that it was not till they were apart, and the witnesses had withdrawn, that she began to expostulate with her son, after they had left the assembly. However that may be, this complaint was not the result of ambition, but was the expression of grief, which had lasted three days. <span class="cite-ref">(238)</span> Yet the manner of her complaint, as if she had received an injury, shows how ready we are by nature to defend our own rights, even without paying regard to God. The holy virgin would a thousand times <span class="cite-ref">(239)</span> rather have died, than deliberately preferred herself to God: but, in the indulgence of a mother’s grief, she falls into it through inadvertency. And undoubtedly this example warns us, how jealous we ought to be of all the affections of the flesh, and what care we ought to exercise, lest, by being too tenacious of our rights, and following our own desires, we defraud God of his honor. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(238)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais l'ennuy et la fascherie qu'elle avoit eue trois jours durant l'a fait ainsi parler</span>.” — “But the uneasiness and distress, which she had had for three days, made her speak in this manner.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(239)</span> “Centies;” — “mille fois.” </p></div></div>
