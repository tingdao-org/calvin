<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>20.</strong><em>Giving thanks always. </em>He means that this is a pleasure which ought never to lose its relish; that this is an exercise of which we ought never to weary. Innumerable benefits which we receive from God yield fresh cause of joy and thanksgiving. At the same time, he reminds believers that it will argue ungodly and disgraceful sloth, if they shall not <em>always </em>give thanks, — if their whole life shall not be spent in the study and exercise of praising God. </p></div>
