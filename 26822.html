<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">彼拉多就对他说，这样，你是王吗？耶稣回答说，你说我是王。我为此而生，也为此来到世间，特为给真理作见证。凡属真理的人，就听我的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>Thou sayest that I am a king. </em>Although Pilate had already learned, from the former answer, that Christ claims for himself some sort of kingdom, yet now Christ asserts the same thing more firmly; and, not satisfied with this, he makes an additional statement, which serves for a seal, as it were, to ratify what he had said. Hence we infer, that the doctrine concerning Christ’s <em>kingdom </em>is of no ordinary importance, since he has deemed it worthy of so solemn an affirmation. </p><p><em>For this cause was I born, that I may bear witness to the truth. </em>This is, no doubt, a general sentiment; but it must be viewed in relation to the place which it holds in the present passage. The words mean, that it is natural for Christ to speak <em>the truth; </em>and, next, that he was sent <em>for this purpose </em>by the Father; and, consequently, that this is his peculiar office. There is no danger, therefore, that we shall be deceived by trusting him, since it is impossible that he who has been commissioned by God, and whose natural disposition leads him to maintain <em>the truth, </em>shall teach any thing that is not <em>true. </em></p><p><em>Every one that is of the truth. </em>Christ added this, not so much for the purpose of exhorting Pilate, (for he knew that he would gain nothing by doing so,) as of defending his doctrine against the base reproaches which had been east on it; as if he had said, “It is imputed to me as a crime that I have asserted that <em>I am a king; </em>and yet this is an unquestionable truth, which is received with reverence and without hesitation by all who have a correct judgment and a sound understanding.” When he says, that they are <em>of the truth </em>he does not mean that they naturally know the truth, but that they are directed by the Spirit of God. </p></div>
