<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And the passover of the Jews was at hand; therefore Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </em>The Greek words <span class="lang el-gr">καὶ ἀνέβη</span>, may be literally rendered, and <em>he went up</em>; but the Evangelist has used the copulative and instead of <em>therefore</em>; for he means that Christ <em>went up </em>at that time, in order to celebrate <em>the passover </em>at Jerusalem. There were two reasons why he did so; for since the Son of God became subject to the Law on our account, he intended, by observing with exactness all the precepts of the Law, to present in his own person a pattern of entire subjection and obedience. Again, as he could do more good, when there was a multitude of people, he almost always availed himself of such an occasion. Whenever, therefore, we shall afterwards find it said that Christ came to Jerusalem at the feast, let the reader observe that he did so, first, that along with others he might observe the exercises of religion which God had appointed, and, next, that he might publish his doctrine amidst a larger concourse of people. </p></div>
