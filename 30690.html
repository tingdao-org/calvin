<div class="CUV verse">亲爱的弟兄阿，你们要记念我们主耶稣基督之使徒从前所说的话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>But, beloved</em>. To a most ancient prophecy he now adds the admonitions of the apostles, the memory of whom was recent. As to the verb <span class="lang el-gr">μνήσθητε</span>, it makes no great difference, whether you read it as declarative or as an exhortation; for the meaning remains the same, that being fortified by the prediction he quotes, they ought to be terrified. </p></div>
