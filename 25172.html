<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们饱足的人有祸了。因为你们将要饥饿。你们喜笑的人有祸了。因为你们将要哀恸哭泣。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Woe to you who are filled. Woe to you who laugh now </em>In the same sense, he pronounces a curse on those who are <em>satiated and full: </em>because they are lifted up by confidence in the blessings of the present life, and reject those blessings which are of a heavenly nature. A similar view must be taken of what he says about <em>laughter: </em>for by those who <em>laugh </em>he means those who have given themselves up to Epicurean mirth, who are plunged in carnal pleasures, and spurn every kind of trouble which would be found necessary for maintaining the glory of God. </p></div>
