<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>And the Lord heard the voice of your words. </em>I have shown elsewhere what is meant by God’s hearing, <em>i.e., </em>that nothing can be concealed from Him, but that tie will take account of and judge all our words and deeds And this is worthy of our observation; for men would never dare to murmur against Him, unless they promised themselves impunity <span class="cite-ref">(75)</span> from His not being present. Secondly, we learn from hence, that God, who is a just Judge, does not proceed hastily and without cause to inflict punishment on men, and that He does not manifest severity without a full examination of the case. He, therefore, means that they deprived themselves of their assured inheritance, when they were close upon receiving it, through their own rebellion and depravity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(75)</span> Sous ombre qu’il ne prend point garde a ce qui ce fait ici bas;” under the pretext that He pays no attention to what is done here below. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
