<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">神听见，就发怒，极其憎恶以色列人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>59</strong><em>God heard it, and was wroth. </em>The prophet again shows that God, when he found that no good resulted from his long-suffering, which the people abused, yea, even treated with mockery, and perverted as an encouragement to greater excess in sinning, at length proceeded to inflict severe punishments upon them. The metaphor, which he borrows from earthly judges, is frequently to be met with in the Scriptures. When God is said <em>to hear, </em>it is not meant that it is necessary for him to make inquisition, but it is intended to teach us that he does not rush forth inconsiderately to execute his judgments, and thus to prevent any from supposing that he ever acts precipitately. The amount of what is stated is, that the people continued so pertinaciously in their wickedness, that at length the cry of it ascended to heaven; and the very weight of the punishment demonstrated the aggravated nature of the offense. </p></div>
