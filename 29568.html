<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为主的道从你们那里已经传扬出来，你们向神的信心不但在马其顿和亚该亚，就是在各处，也都传开了。所以不用我们说什么话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>For from you sounded forth</em>. Here we have an elegant metaphor, by which he intimates that their faith was so lively, <span class="cite-ref">(507)</span> that it did, as it were, by its <em>sound</em>, arouse other nations. For he says that the word of God <em>sounded forth </em>from them, inasmuch as their faith was <em>sonorous </em><span class="cite-ref">(508)</span> for procuring credit for the gospel. He says that this had not only occurred in neighboring places, but this <em>sound </em>had also extended far and wide, and had been distinctly heard, so that the matter did not require to be published by him. <span class="cite-ref">(509)</span></p><p><strong>(507)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Si viue et vertueuse</span>;” — “So lively and virtuous.” </p><p><strong>(508)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Auoit resonné haut et clair</span>;” — “Had resounded loud and clear.” </p><p><strong>(509)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Tellement que la chose n’ha point besoin d’estre par luy diuulgee et magnifiee d’auantage</span>;” — “So that the matter does not need to be farther published and extolled by him.” </p></div>
