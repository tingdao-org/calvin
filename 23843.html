<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And have you never read? </em>The scribes and priests seize on this as an opportunity of calumniating Christ, that he allows himself to be called a King by <em>children; </em>as it is always the custom of wicked people haughtily to despise the mean condition of the disciples of Christ. This malicious design Christ checks by a quotation from David, who makes even <em>infants </em>to be the heralds of the glory of God. Literally the words run, </p><p>Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings thou hast founded strength, (<span class="bvs">Psa_8:2</span>;) </p><p>by which David means that, though every tongue were silent, <span class="cite-ref">(19)</span> God needs no other orators to proclaim his power than mere <em>infants, </em>who are still hanging on their mothers’ breasts. In themselves, no doubt, they are silent; but the wonderful providence of God, which shines in them, serves the purpose of splendid and powerful eloquence. For he who considers with himself how the child is formed in the mother’s womb, is nourished there for nine months, afterwards comes into the world, and finds nourishment provided as soon as it is born, must not only acknowledge that God is the Creator of the world, but will be altogether carried away into admiration of Him. <span class="cite-ref">(20)</span> Thus the sun and moon, though they are dumb creatures, are said to have a loud and distinct voice for singing the praises of God, (<span class="bvs">Psa_19:1</span>.) But since the praises of God are heard from the tongue of <em>infants, </em>Christ infers from this, that it is not strange if He cause them to be uttered by <em>children </em>who have already acquired the use of speech. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(19)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quand toutes bouches seroyent closes, et toutes langues se tairoyent</span>;” — “though every mouth were closed, and every tongue were silent.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(20)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Mais aussi il entrera en une grande admiration de sa puissance et sagesse infinie</span>;” — “but also will greatly admire His infinite power and wisdom.” </p></div></div>
