<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们若有彼此相爱的心，众人因此就认出你们是我的门徒了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>By this all men will know. </em>Christ again confirms what he had formerly said, that they who mutually love one another have not been in vain taught in his school; as if he had said, Not only will you know that you are my disciples, but your profession will also be acknowledged by others to be sincere.” Since Christ lays down this mark for distinguishing between his disciples and strangers, they who lay aside brotherly love, and adopt new and invented modes of worship, labor in vain; and folly of this kind prevails at this day in Popery. Nor is it superfluous that Christ dwells so largely on this subject. There is no greater agreement between the love of ourselves, and the love of our neighbor, than there is between fire and water. Self love keeps all our senses bound in such a manner that brotherly love is altogether banished; and yet we think that we fully discharge our duty, because Satan has many enticements to deceive us, that we may not perceive our faults. <span class="cite-ref">(59)</span> Whoever, then, desires to be truly a disciple of Christ, and to be acknowledged by God, let him form and direct his whole life to love the brethren, and let him pursue this object with diligence. </p><p><strong>(59)</strong> “<span class="lang fr-fr">A ce que nous n’appercevions nos fautes</span>.” </p></div>
