<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当日杀毙的人，连男带女共有一万二千，就是艾城所有的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>And so it was that all that fell that day, </em>etc The meaning is not that all the slain were inhabitants of Ai, but that all who dwelt in it were slain, that not one escaped. It has already been seen that the inhabitants of Bethel were mingled along with them; and as no mention of that city is afterwards made, it may be conjectured with some probability that they had abandoned their own town, which was little fortified, and betaken themselves for greater safety to one which they hoped could be easily defended. The words, therefore, simply mean, that all who had come out of the city and all who were found in it were slain to a man. If any are rather disposed to think that this number of those whose slaughter took place within the walls is confined to the aged, the sick, the women and the children, I will not dispute the matter. Still, if we consider that only a small town was conjoined with a city of no great extent or population, it is more probable that the number comprehends those also who fell in battle. </p></div>
