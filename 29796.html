<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8</strong><em>Having food and raiment </em>When he mentions <em>food and raiment, </em>he excludes luxuries and overflowing abundance; for nature is content with a little <span class="cite-ref">(122)</span> and all that goes beyond the natural use is superfluous. Not that to use them more largely ought to be condemned on its own account, but lusting after them is always sinful. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(122)</span> “Man wants but little; nor that little long.” — <em>Young’s Night Thoughts. </em></p></div></div>
