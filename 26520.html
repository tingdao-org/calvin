<div class="CUV verse">他们又要拿他。他却逃出他们的手走了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39.</strong><em>Therefore they sought again to seize him. </em>This was undoubtedly that they might drive him out of the temple, and immediately stone him; for their rage was not at all abated by the words of Christ. As to what the Evangelist says, that <em>he escaped out of their hands, </em>this could not be accomplished in any other way than by a wonderful exertion of Divine power. This reminds us that we are not exposed to the lawless passions of wicked men, which God restrains by his bridle, whenever he thinks fit. </p></div>
