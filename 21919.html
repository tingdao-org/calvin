<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Now, when Daniel’s calumniators see that King Darius had no wish to defend his cause, they open up more freely what they had previously conceded; for, as we have said, if they had openly accused Daniel, their accusation could have been instantly and completely refuted; but after this sentiment had been expressed to the king, their statement is final, since by the laws of the Medes and Persians a king’s decree ought to be self-acting; hence, after this is accomplished, they then come to the person. <em>Daniel, </em>say they, <em>one of the captives of Judah, has not obeyed thy will, O king, nor the decree which thou hast signed. </em>By saying, “Daniel, one of the Jewish captives,” they doubtless intended to magnify his crime and to render him odious. For if any Chaldean had dared to despise the king’s edict, his rashness would not have been excused. But now when Daniel, who was lately a slave and a Chaldean captive, dares to despise the king’s command, who reigned over Chaldea by the right of conquest, this seemed less tolerable still. The effect is the same as if they had said, “He was lately a captive among thy slaves; thou art supreme lord, and his masters to whom he was subject are under thy yoke, because thou art their conqueror; he is but a captive and a stranger, a mere slave, and yet he rebels against thee!” We see then how they desired to poison the king’s mind against him by this allusion, <em>He is one of the captives! </em>The words are very harmless in themselves, but they endeavor to sting their monarch in every way, and to stir up his wrath against Daniel. <em>He does not direct his mind to thee, O king; </em>that is, he does not reflect upon who you are, and thus he despises thy majesty and <em>the edict which thou hast signed </em>This is another enlargement: <em>Daniel, </em>therefore, <em>did not direct his mind either to thee or to thy edict; </em>and wilt thou bear this? Next, they recite the deed itself — he <em>prays three times a-day </em>This would have been the simple narrative, Daniel has not obeyed thy command in praying to his own God; but, as I have said, they exaggerate his crime by accusing him of pride, contempt, and insolence. We see, therefore, by what artifices Daniel was oppressed by these malicious men. It now follows: </p></div>
