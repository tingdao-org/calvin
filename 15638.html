<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他说一声，苍蝇就成群而来，并有虱子进入他们四境。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>31.</strong><em>He spake, and there came a swarm of flies </em>By the word <em>spake </em>the Psalmist intimates that <em>the flies </em>and <em>lice </em>came not forth by chance. The command, we know, was uttered by the mouth of Moses; for although God could have given the command himself, he interposed Moses as his herald. God, however, gave no less efficacy to his word, when he commanded it to be uttered by a man, than if he himself had thundered from heaven. When the minister executes his commission faithfully, by speaking only what God puts into his mouth, the inward power of the Holy Spirit is joined with his outward voice. Here again it is to be observed, that the Egyptians were afflicted with the plague of the flies and lice, that God, with the greater ignominy, might subdue their rebellion and obstinacy. When it is said, that he <em>gave them hail for rain, </em>it denotes a hail of such appalling violence, that it could not be attributed to natural causes. It is probable that Egypt is not so subject to this annoyance as other countries, and it is very seldom visited even with rain, being watered with the Nile. This made it appear to the Egyptians the more wonderful that their country was stricken with hail. To render this calamity the more dreadful, God also mingled with it fire. The hail, then, was accompanied with a tempestuous whirlwind, that the Egyptians who had hardened themselves against the other miracles, inspired with terror, might know that they had to deal with God. </p></div>
