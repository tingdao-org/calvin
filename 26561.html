<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>38.</strong><em>Jesus therefore again groaning within himself. </em>Christ does not approach the sepulcher as an idle spectator, but as a champion who prepares for a contest; and therefore we need not wonder that he <em>again groans</em>; for the violent tyranny of death, which he had to conquer, is placed before his eyes. Some explain this groan to have arisen from indignation, because he was offended at that unbelief of which we have spoken. But another reason appears to me far more appropriate, namely, that he contemplated the transaction itself rather than the men. Next follow various circumstances, which tend to display more fully the power of Christ in raising Lazarus. I refer to the time of<em>four days</em>, during which <em>the tomb </em>had been secured by <em>a stone</em>, which Christ commands to be removed in presence of all. </p></div>
