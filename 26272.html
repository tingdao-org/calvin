<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>Those men, therefore. </em>The miracle appears to have been attended by some advantage, that they acknowledge the author of it to be the Messiah; for Christ had no other object in view. But immediately they apply to a different and improper purpose the knowledge which they have obtained concerning Christ. And it is a fault extremely common among men, to corrupt and pervert his truth by their falsehoods, as soon as he has revealed himself to them; and even when they appear to have entered into the right path, they immediately fall away. </p></div>
