<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">可见那以信为本的人，和有信心的亚伯拉罕一同得福。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Faithful Abraham</em>. This expression is very emphatic. They <em>are blessed</em>, not with Abraham as circumcised, nor as entitled to boast of the works of the law, nor as a Hebrew, nor as relying on his own excellence, but with Abraham, who by faith alone obtained the blessing; for no personal quality is here taken into the account, but faith alone. The word Blessing is variously employed in Scripture: but here it signifies Adoption into the inheritance of eternal life. </p></div>
