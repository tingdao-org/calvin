<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">众首领就打发古示的曾孙，示利米雅的孙子，尼探雅的儿子犹底到巴录那里，对他说，你将所念给百姓听的书卷拿在手中到我们这里来。尼利亚的儿子巴录就手拿书卷来到他们那里。</div></div>

They commanded him to come, and it is added, that having taken the roll he <em>came to them; </em>by which he manifested his firmness. His promptitude previously was commendable, that he ventured to go forth to the Temple and publicly to recite what tended to kindle the rage of the whole people. As in the beginning, he promptly undertook the office deputed to him, so now he persevered in the same course. He came to the princes; and he did not hide the roll, though he might have been carrying with him his own death, but he boldly went forth to them, for he knew that the whole business was under the direction of God.
