<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And thou shalt say unto them. </em>He repeats what we have seen in Exodus, that they should kill two lambs daily, one in the morning, and the other in the evening; but he speaks more fully of the concomitants of flour and wine, and also refers to the antiquity of this kind of sacrifice as its recommendation, because it began to be offered to God on Mount Sinai, and was a “savor of rest.” <span class="cite-ref">(236)</span> The libation of wine, of which mention is made, was also in use among heathen nations; but, inasmuch as it was without the command and promise of God, it could not but be unmeaning (<em>insipidum </em>) <span class="cite-ref">(237)</span> And it is probable (as we have seen elsewhere) that many of the heathen rites descended from the ancient fathers but as a false and empty imitation; for when they had forgotten the reason of them, all they did could only be a mere theatrical pageantry. But we have said that thus men were reminded always to have God before their eyes in their daily food; and therefore in every way to accustom themselves to cultivate holiness. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(236)</span><em>A.V., </em>“a sweet savor.” <em>Margin, “Heb., </em>a savor of my rest." </p><p><span class="cite-note">(237)</span><em>Fr., “ </em><span class="lang fr-fr">c’a este moins que ripopper, comme on dit</span>;” <em>Ripope, </em>i.e.,bad wine. </p></div></div>
