<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们也不要行奸淫，像他们有人行的，一天就倒毙了二万三千人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Neither let us commit fornication </em>Now he speaks of <em>fornication</em>, in respect of which, as appears from historical accounts, great licentiousness prevailed among the Corinthians, and we may readily infer from what goes before, that those who had professed themselves to be Christ’s were not yet altogether free from this vice. The punishment of this vice, also, ought to alarm us, and lead us to bear in mind, how loathsome impure lusts are to God, for there perished in one day twenty-three thousand, or as Moses says, twenty-four. Though they differ as to number, it is easy to reconcile them, as it is no unusual thing, when it is not intended to number exactly and minutely each head, <span class="cite-ref">(546)</span> to put down a number that comes near it, as among the Romans there were those that received the name of <em>Centumviri </em>, <span class="cite-ref">(547)</span> (The <em>Hundred</em>,) while in reality there were two above the hundred. As there were, therefore, about twenty-four thousand that were overthrown by the Lord’s hand — that is, above twenty-three, Moses has set down the number <em>above </em>the mark, and Paul, the number <em>below </em>it, and in this way there is in reality no difference. This history is recorded in <span class="bvs">Num_25:9</span></p><p>There remains, however, one difficulty here — why it is that Paul attributes this punishment to fornication, while Moses relates that the anger of God was aroused against the people on this account — that they had initiated themselves in the sacred rites of Baalpeor. <span class="cite-ref">(548)</span> But as the defection began with fornication, and the children of Israel fell into that impiety, not so much from being influenced by religious considerations, <span class="cite-ref">(549)</span> as from being allured by the enticements of harlots, everything evil that followed from it ought to be attributed to fornication. For Balaam had given this counsel, that the Midianites should prostitute their daughters to the Israelites, with the view of estranging them from the true worship of God. Nay more, their excessive blindness, in allowing themselves to be drawn into impiety <span class="cite-ref">(550)</span> by the enticements of harlots, was the punishment of lust. Let us learn, accordingly, that fornication is no light offense, which was punished on that occasion by God so severely and indeed in a variety of ways. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(546)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De faire vn denombrement entier des personnes par testes, comme on dit</span>;” — “To make a complete enumeration of persons by heads, as they say.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(547)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Les juges qui estoyent deputez pour cognoistre des matieres ciuiles, estoyent nommez les cent, et toutes lois il yen auoit deux par dessus</span>;” — “The judges who were deputed to take cognizance of civil matters were called The Hundred, and yet there were two above the hundred.” As the Centumviri were chosen out of the thirty-five tribes, into which the Roman people were divided, three from each tribe, they consisted properly of 105 persons. — <em>Ed</em>. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(548)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Auoit sacrifie a Baalpheor</span>;” — “Had sacrificed to Baalpeor.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(549)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Non pas tant pour affection qu’ils eussent a la fausse religion</span>;” — “Not so much from any attachment that they had to a false religion.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(550)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Vne impiete si vileine</span>;” — “An impiety so base.” </p></div></div>
