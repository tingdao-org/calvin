<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他爱咒骂，咒骂就临到他。他不喜爱福乐，福乐就与他远离。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17</strong><em>As he loved cursing </em>David still continues to enumerate the sins of his adversaries, and is thus severe in his treatment of them, in order to render it more apparent, that he is strictly conforming to the judgment of God. For as often as we draw near to the tribunal of God, we must take care that the equity of our cause may be so sure and evident as to secure for it and us a favorable reception from him. Fortified by the testimony of an approving conscience, David here declares his readiness to commit the matter between him and his enemies to the judgment of God. The words, which are expressive of cursing and blessing, are in the past tense, <em>cursing came upon him, and blessing was far from him, </em>but it is necessary to translate them as expressive of a wish or desire; for David continues to pray that his enemy may be visited with the same unparalleled ills which he had inflicted upon others. A stranger to every act of kindness, and taking pleasure in doing evil, it is the wish of the Psalmist that he may now be subjected to every species of calamity. Some take <em>malediction </em>to mean <em>cursing and imprecation, </em>thereby intimating that this man was so addicted to execration, that mischief and malevolence were constantly in his heart, and proceeding from his lips. While I do not reject this opinion, I am yet disposed to take a more extended view of the passage, That by injury and abuse, he aimed at the suppression and abolition of every mark of kindness, and that he took delight in the calamities which he beheld coming upon the unsuspecting and the good. </p></div>
