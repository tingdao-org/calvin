<div class="CUV verse"></div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><span class="cite-ref">(75)</span><em>Of the ministry and apostleship. </em>Because the word ministry was base, he addeth apostleship, wherein there is greater dignity; although the sense shall be more plain if you expound it, “the ministry of the apostleship.” For the figure <em>hypallage </em>is common in the Scriptures. Assuredly Luke meant to join with the burden the excellency of the office, that it might have the greater reverence and authority; and yet this was his intent also, to declare that the apostles are called unto a painful function. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(75)</span> There is here a transposition in the translation. The 26<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse precedes the 25<span class="cite-ref">th</span>. </p></div></div>
