<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣又说，你们中间谁有一个朋友，半夜到他那里去说，朋友，请借给我三个饼。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_11:5</span><strong>.</strong><em>Which of you shall have a friend, Luke </em>adds this comparison, which is not mentioned by Matthew. The general instruction conveyed by it is this: Believers ought not to be discouraged, if they do not immediately obtain their desires, or if they find them difficult to be obtained: for if, among men, importunity of asking extorts what a person would not willingly do, we have no reason to doubt that God will listen to us, if we persevere constantly in prayer, and if our minds do not slacken through difficulty or delay. </p></div>
