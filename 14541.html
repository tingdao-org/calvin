<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">愿那些对我说，阿哈，阿哈的，因羞愧而败亡。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>When the Psalmist prays (verse 15) that his enemies <em>may be destroyed for a reward of their shame, </em>the meaning is this: As their sole desire has been to overwhelm me with shame, in order that, while thus dismayed and confounded, they might make me the object of their derision; so let a similar confusion fall upon their own heads. In the second clause of the verse he describes the nature of this confusion by relating the terms of their wicked triumphing, by which they poured contempt upon him while he was so oppressed with misery and affliction. We are here taught that, when our enemies shall have persecuted us to the uttermost, a recompense is also prepared for them; and that God will turn back, and cause to fall upon their own heads, all the evil which they had devised against us; and this doctrine ought to act as a restraint upon us, that we may behave ourselves compassionately and kindly towards our neighbors. </p></div>
