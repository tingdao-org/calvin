<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约柜停住的时候，他就说，耶和华阿，求你回到以色列的千万人中。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>36.</strong><em>And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord. </em>By thus praying he also exhorts the people to be patient, lest the weariness which arose from the delay should beget indignation. Otherwise it would have been annoying that the time of their journeying should be protracted, so that they would arrive the later at their rest. And we see, indeed, how their minds were exasperated, as if a slower progress was a kind of disappointment. In order, therefore, to correct this impatience, Moses reminds them that their halts were advantageous to them, so that God, dwelling at home like the father of a family, might manifest His care of them; for the allusion is to men who Lake advantage of a time of repose and release from other business, to occupy themselves more un-restrainedly in paying attention to their own family. </p></div>
