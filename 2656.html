<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And Bezaleel, the son of Uri</em>. He again impresses upon us that the whole work was divine, both because Moses faithfully delivered the commands of God, and the artificers followed them with precise accuracy. At the same time, he counts up the whole sum of gold and silver, and shews us on what it was consumed. Hence we gather that every one honestly discharged his duty, and that no one was corrupted or drawn aside by covetousness so as to fall from his integrity. We are also informed from whence the amount of silver was obtained, viz., from the <em>census </em>of the people; for a tax of a common shekel, which was half a shekel of the sanctuary, was imposed on every head, as we <span class="cite-ref">(304)</span> have already seen. Moses now shews that this entire sum was collected and paid without fraud, and so applied as that none should be lost. </p><p><strong>(304)</strong> See on <span class="bvs">Exo_30:12</span>, vol. 1, p. 482. </p></div>
