<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_23:39</span><strong>.</strong><em>And one of the malefactors. </em>This reproach, which the Son of God endured from the <em>robber, </em>obtained for us among angels the very high honor of acknowledging us to be their brethren. But at the same time, an example of furious obstinacy is held out to us in this wretched man, since even in the midst of his torments he does not cease fiercely to foam out his blasphemies. Thus desperate men are wont to take obstinate revenge for the torments which they cannot avoid. <span class="cite-ref">(274)</span> And although he upbraids Christ with not being able to save either himself or others, yet this objection is directed against God himself; just as wicked men, when they do not obtain what they wish, would willingly tear God from heaven. They ought, indeed, to be tamed to humility by strokes; but this shows that the wicked heart, which no punishments can bend, is hard like iron. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(274)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Voyans qu’ils ne peuvent eschapper les tormens, ils se vengent en s’obstinant et rongeant leur frein, comme on dit</span>.” — “Perceiving that they cannot escape torments, they take revenge by obstinacy, and by <em>champing the bit</em>, as the saying is.” </p></div></div>
