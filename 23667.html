<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">门徒说，我们在这野地，哪里有这么多的饼，叫这许多人吃饱呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>33.</strong><em>Whence shall we obtain so many loaves in a solitary place? </em>The disciples manifest excessive stupidity in not remembering, at least, that earlier proof of the power and grace of Christ, which they might have applied to the case in hand. As if they had never seen any thing of the same sort, they forget to apply to him for relief. There is not a day on which a similar indifference does not steal upon us; and we ought to be the more careful not to allow our minds to be drawn away from the contemplation of divine benefits, that the experience of the past may lead us to expect for the future the same assistance which God has already on one or more occasions bestowed upon us. </p></div>
