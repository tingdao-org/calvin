<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这器皿就是我们被神所召的，不但是从犹太人中，也是从外邦人中，这有什么不可呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Whom he also called, etc. </em>From the reasoning which he has been hitherto carrying on respecting the freedom of divine election, two things follow, — that the grace of God is not so confined to the Jewish people that it does not also flow to other nations, and diffuse itself through the whole world, — and then, that it is not even so tied to the Jews that it comes without exception to all the children of Abraham according to the flesh; for if God’s election is based on his own good pleasure alone, wherever his will turns itself, there his election exists. Election being then established, the way is now in a manner prepared for him to proceed to those things which he designed to say respecting the calling of the Gentiles, and also respecting the rejection of the Jews; the first of which seemed strange for its novelty, and the other wholly unbecoming. As, however, the last had more in it to offend, he speaks in the first place of that which was less disliked. He says then, that the vessels of God’s mercy, whom he selects for the glory of his name, are taken from every people, from the Gentiles no less than from the Jews. </p><p>But though in the relative <em>whom </em>the rule of grammar is not fully observed by Paul, <span class="cite-ref">(309)</span> yet his object was, by making as it were a transition, to subjoin that we are the vessels of God’s glory, who have been taken in part from the Jews and in part from the Gentiles; and he proves from the calling of God, that there is no difference between nations made in election. For if to be descended from the Gentiles was no hinderance that God should not call us, it is evident that the Gentiles are by no means to be excluded from the kingdom of God and the covenant of eternal salvation. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(309)</span> It is an instance of Hebraism, the use of a double <em>pronoun </em>— <em>whom </em>and <em>us</em>, governed by the same verb. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
