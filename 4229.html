<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>34.</strong><em>And all Israel that were round about them. </em>We must suppose that the people were standing around, expecting at a distance the event that was to take place; for they had previously retired from the tents, in token of their separation (from this wicked company.) <span class="cite-ref">(100)</span> That they should now fly in confusion, lest the same destruction should overwhelm themselves, is a sign of their bad conscience, which is always troubled in itself, and agitates the wicked with sore inquietude. It is needful, indeed, that even the pious should be alarmed by God’s judgments, in order that their consternation or dread should instruct them <span class="cite-ref">(101)</span> in his holy fear, and therefore they never reflect without dread on the punishments which God has inflicted upon the crimes of men. But, since hypocrites carry in their hearts a hot iron, as it were, they fall down like dead men, as if the lightning fell from God upon their own heads. Thus we shall presently see that this blind fear profited them but little. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(100)</span> Added from <em>Fr. </em></p><p><span class="cite-note">(101)</span> “A s’humilier devant luy;” to humble themselves before Him. — <em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
