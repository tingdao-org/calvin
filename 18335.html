<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">拉伯沙基对他们说，你们去告诉希西家说，亚述大王如此说，你所倚靠的有什么可仗赖的呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Say now to Hezekiah. </em>He relates that the three ambassadors, though they were attended by all the magnificence that yet remained in the kingdom, were not only repulsed, but disdainfully treated by the tyrant’s delegate, and loaded with disgraceful reproaches; for, as if Hezekiah had been convicted of wicked revolt, Rabshakeh asks how he had dared to rebel. The particle <span class="lang he-il">נא</span> (<em>na</em>) is supposed by some to denote entreaty, and is rendered by them <em>I pray; </em>but it would be unsuitable to a proud and insolent man to entreat in this manner. He speaks in the ordinary language of those who lay conditions on the vanquished, or on those who are overwhelmed with fear, whom they wish to compel to make an unconditional surrender, or, as we commonly say, <em>(sommer) to summon. </em></p><p><em>Thus saith the great king. </em>In order to give greater validity to the summons, that general speaks in the name of his king, whose greatness he extols to the skies, in order to terrify Hezekiah, when he learns that he has to do with a king of such vast resources. He does not only mean that the first monarch in the world was far superior to Hezekiah, who in comparison of him was but a petty prince; but he calls the king of Assyria <em>great, </em>because by his power he eclipsed all others, so that he stood alone in his lofty rank. By these thunderbolts of words Hezekiah might have been overthrown and subdued, especially since he was so far from being able to resist the power of that tyrant that he was shut up in the city and unable to move out of it. </p></div>
