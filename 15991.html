<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我若不是喜爱你的律法，早就在苦难中灭绝了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>92.</strong><em>Had not thy law been my delight </em>The prophet continues to prosecute almost the same theme; affirming, that he would have been undone, had he not in his calamities sought consolation from the law of God. The adverb, <span class="lang he-il">אז</span><em>az, </em>signifies <em>then; </em>but as it is sometimes used for <em>a long time, </em>it is equivalent here to <em>long ago; </em>unless some may prefer to consider it as a significant and emphatic pointing to the thing, as if he were still in the state which he describes. He confirms from his own experience what he had previously said, to make it manifest that he did not speak of things with which he was unacquainted, but that he asserts what he had really experienced, — namely, that there is no other solace, and no other remedy for adversity, but our reposing upon the word of God, and our embracing the grace and the assurance of our salvation which are offered in it. He here unquestionably commends the very same word, which he had but now said dwelt in heaven. Though it resound on earth, enter into our ears, and settle in our hearts, yet it still retains its celestial nature; for it descends to us in such a manner, as that it is not subject to the changes of the world. The prophet declares that he was grievously oppressed by a weight of afflictions enough to overwhelm him; but that the consolation which he derived from the Divine Law in such desperate circumstances, was as life to him. </p></div>
