<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>It shall not be so among you. </em>There can be no doubt that Christ refers to the foolish imagination by which he saw that the apostles were deceived. “It is foolish and improper in you,” he says, “to imagine a kingdom, which is unsuitable to me; and therefore, if you desire to serve me faithfully, you must resort to a different method, which is, that each of you may strive to serve others.” <span class="cite-ref">(666)</span><em>But whoever wishes to be great among you, let him be your servant. </em>These words are employed in an unusual sense; for ambition does not allow a man to be <em>devoted</em>, or, rather, to be <em>subject </em>to his brethren. Abject flattery, I do acknowledge, is practiced by those who aspire to honors, but nothing is farther from their intention than to <em>serve </em>But Christ’s meaning is not difficult to be perceived. As every man is carried away by a love of himself, he declares that this passion ought to be directed to a different object. Let the only greatness, eminence, and rank, which you desire, be, to submit to your brethren; and let this be your primacy, to be the <em>servants </em>of all. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(666)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">De se rendre serviteur a ses compagnons</span>;” — “to become a servant to his companions.” </p></div></div>
