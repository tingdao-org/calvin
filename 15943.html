<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我要常守你的律法，直到永永远远。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>44.</strong><em>I will keep thy law continually </em>He resolves to devote himself to the study of the law, not for a short time only, but even to the termination of his life. The employing of three synonymous words, <span class="lang he-il">תמיד</span>, <em>tamid, </em><span class="lang he-il">עולם</span>,<em>olam, </em><span class="lang he-il">עד</span>,<em>ed, </em>so far from being viewed as a superfluous accumulation of terms, contains an implied indication, that, unless the faithful make a strenuous and steady opposition, the fear of God may be gradually effaced from their minds by various temptations, and they will lose the affection which they bear for the law. In order, therefore, that he may be the better prepared for meeting these trials, he alludes to the difficulty and danger connected with them. </p></div>
