<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那从前有荣光的，因这极大的荣光，就算不得有荣光了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>What was rendered glorious. </em>This is not a correction of what goes before, but rather a confirmation; for he means that the glory of the law is extinguished when the gospel comes forth. As the moon and stars, though in themselves they are not merely luminous, but diffuse their light over the whole earth, do, nevertheless, disappear before the brightness of the sun; so, however glorious the law was in itself, it has, nevertheless, no glory in comparison with the excellence of the gospel. Hence it follows, that we cannot sufficiently prize, or hold in sufficient esteem the glory of Christ, which shines forth in the gospel, like the splendor of the sun when beaming forth; and that the gospel is foolishly handled, nay more, is shamefully profaned, where the power and majesty of the Spirit do not come forth to view, so as to draw up men’s minds and hearts heavenward. </p></div>
