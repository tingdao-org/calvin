<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">谁心里也不醒悟，也没有知识，没有聪明，能说，我曾拿一分在火中烧了，在炭火上烤过饼，我也烤过肉吃，这剩下的，我岂要作可憎的物吗？我岂可向木？？子叩拜呢？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>It doth not return into their heart. </em>He confirms the preceding statement, and takes away every ground of excuse, because unbelievers of their own accord cherish their ignorance. That men are naturally careful and provident in worldly matters, but altogether blind in the worship of God, proceeds from no other cause than that they are abundantly attentive to their individual interests, but are not moved by any anxiety about the heavenly kingdom. Hence the Prophet reproves them for disregarding godliness, because, after long windings, unbelievers do not reflect whether they are keeping the right way, or, on the other hand, are uselessly fatiguing themselves with wicked errors, <span class="cite-ref">(183)</span> He shews that their slothfulness is without excuse, because they are so much devoted to their superstitions; for if they applied their mind for a short time to consider the matter, nothing would be more easy than to perceive that stupidity; and, since they do not see it, it follows that they wish to be deceived, and that they flatter themselves in their error. They cannot, therefore, bring forward any palliation or excuse for their guilt, and cannot plead ignorance; for they do not design to apply their mind to the labor of investigating truth. To “return into the heart” <span class="cite-ref">(184)</span> means “to consider and reflect;” for no child is so ignorant as not to be a competent judge of such extraordinary madness. Superstitious persons therefore give themselves too unlimited indulgence, and do not err merely through ignorance; and this vice ought not to be ascribed solely to the first corruption of men, but to rebellion. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(183)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Apres des erreurs et superstitions</span>.” “After errors and superstitions.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(184)</span> “The first phrase does not correspond exactly to the English ‘Lay to heart,’ but comprehends reflection and emotion.” — <em>Alexander. </em></p></div></div>
