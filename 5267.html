<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">只是你分别为圣的物和你的还愿祭要奉到耶和华所选择的地方去。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26</strong><em>Only thy holy things. </em>This passage more clearly explains what was meant by the foregoing precepts, viz., that but one place was set apart for the performance of their sacred rites, lest, if each should offer wherever it pleased him, religion should be corrupted, and by degrees the various altars should beget as many gods. He therefore commands that all the victims should be sacrificed on one altar, with a provision that the blood should be poured out. </p></div>
