<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>28.</strong><em>Whom we preach. </em>Here he applies to his own preaching everything that he has previously declared as to the wonderful and adorable secret of God; and thus he explains what he had already touched upon as to the <em>dispensation </em>which had been committed to him; for he has it in view to adorn his apostleship, and to claim authority for his doctrine: for after having extolled the gospel in the highest terms, he now adds, that it is that divine secret which he preaches. It was not, however, without good reason that he had taken notice a little before, that Christ is the sum of that secret, that they might know that nothing can be taught that has more of perfection than Christ. </p><p>The expressions that follow have also great weight. He represents himself as the teacher of all men; meaning by this, that no one is so eminent in respect of wisdom as to be entitled to exempt himself from tuition. “God has placed me in a lofty position, as a public herald of his secret, that the whole world, without exception, may learn from me.” </p><p><em>In all wisdom. </em>This expression is equivalent to his affirming that his doctrine is such as to conduct a man to a wisdom that is perfect, and has nothing wanting; and this is what he immediately adds, that all that shew themselves to be true disciples will become <em>perfect</em>. See the second chapter of First Corinthians. (<span class="bvs">1Co_2:6</span>.) Now, what better thing can be desired than what confers upon us the highest perfection? He again repeats, <em>in Christ</em>, that they may not desire to know anything but Christ alone. From this passage, also, we may gather a definition of true wisdom — that by which we are presented perfect in the sight of God, and that <em>in Christ</em>, and nowhere else. <span class="cite-ref">(343)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(343)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et non en autre</span>;” — “And not in another.” </p></div></div>
