<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">（亚萨的诗歌，交与伶长，用丝弦的乐器。）在犹大神为人所认识。在以色列他的名为大。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>God is known in Judah. </em>In the outset, we are taught that it was not by human means that the enemies of Israel were compelled to retire without accomplishing any thing, but by the ever-to-be-remembered aid of Jehovah. Whence came <em>that knowledge of God and the greatness of his name </em>which are spoken of, but because He stretched forth his hand in an extraordinary manner, to make it openly manifest that both the chosen people and the city were under his defense and protection? It is therefore asserted, that the glory of God was conspicuously displayed when the enemies of Israel were discomfited by such a miraculous interposition. </p></div>
