<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但摩西的手发沉，他们就搬石头来，放在他以下，他就坐在上面。亚伦与户珥扶着他的手，一个在这边，一个在那边，他的手就稳住，直到日落的时候。</div></div>
