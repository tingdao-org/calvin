<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣第二次又对他说，约翰的儿子西门，你爱我吗？彼得说，主阿，是的。你知道我爱你。耶稣说，你牧养我的羊。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>Feed my sheep. </em>Christ does not give to Peter and others the office <em>of feeding </em>all sorts of persons, but only <em>his sheep </em>or <em>his lambs. </em>He elsewhere describes who they are whom he reckons to belong to his flock. </p><p>My sheep, says he, hear my voice, and follow me; they hear not the voice of a stranger, <LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Joh_10:5</span>.) </p><p>True, faithful teachers ought to endeavor to gather all to Christ; and as they cannot distinguish between <em>sheep </em>and wild beasts, they ought to try by all methods if they can tame those who resemble wolves rather than <em>sheep. </em>But after having put forth their utmost efforts, their labor will be of no avail to any but the elect <em>sheep; </em>for docility and faith arise from this, that the heavenly Father delivers to his Son, that they may obey him, those whom he elected before the creation of the world. Again, we are taught by this passage, that none can <em>be fed </em>to salvation by the doctrine of the Gospel but those who are mild and teachable; for it is not without reason that Christ compares his disciples to <em>lambs </em>and <em>sheep; </em>but it must also be observed, that the Spirit of God tames those who by nature were bears or lions. </p></div>
