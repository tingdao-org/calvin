<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在这日以前，这日以后，耶和华听人的祷告，没有像这日的，是因耶和华为以色列争战。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>And there was no day like that, </em>etc We read in Isaiah and in the Sacred History, that the course of the sun was afterwards changed as a favor to King Hezekiah. (<span class="bvs">Isa_38:5</span>) For to assure him that his life was still to be prolonged fifteen years, the shadow of the sun was carried back over ten degrees on which it had gone down. It is not, therefore, absolutely denied that anything similar had ever been conceded to any other person, but the miracle is extolled as singular. The rendering of the word <span class="lang he-il">שמע</span>, by <em>obeyed, </em>as adopted by some, I reject as too harsh. For although it is said in <span class="bvs">Psa_145:18</span>, that the Lord does according to the desire of his servants, which may be held to be equivalent to obeying, it is better to avoid anything which seems to give a subordinate office to God. <span class="cite-ref">(98)</span> Simply, therefore, the excellence of the miracle is praised, as nothing like it had been seen before or had happened after. The second clause of the verse celebrates the kindness and condescension of God in hearing Joshua, as well as his paternal favor towards the people, for whom he is said to have fought. </p><p><strong>(98)</strong> French, “<span class="lang fr-fr">Neantmoins si est ce meilleur d’eviter toujours toutes facons de parler derogantes a la majeste de Dieu, comme s’il estoit question de la ranger</span>;” “Nevertheless it is better to avoid all modes of speaking derogatory to the majesty of God, as if it were intended to make him subordinate.” — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
