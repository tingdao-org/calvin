<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">此后，我们转回，从红海的路往旷野去，是照耶和华所吩咐我的。我们在西珥山绕行了许多日子。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>Then we turned and took our journey. </em>The time in which they struck their camp is not stated in the book of Numbers. This verse, therefore, will aptly connect the history, since otherwise there would be an abruptness in what immediately follows, he then briefly indicates what was the nature of their journeying until the time appointed; viz., that, by wearying themselves in vain in circuitous wanderings, they might, at length, learn to follow God directly, and not to decline from the way which He points out. </p></div>
