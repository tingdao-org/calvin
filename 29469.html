<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4</strong><em>. Having heard of your faith. </em>This was a means of stirring up his love towards them, and his concern for their welfare, when he heard it that they were distinguished by <em>faith </em>and <em>love. </em>And, unquestionably, gifts of God that are so excellent ought to have such an effect upon us as to stir us up to love them wherever they appear. He uses the expression, <em>faith in Christ</em>, that we may always bear in mind that Christ is the proper object of faith. </p><p>He employs the expression, <em>love towards the saints</em>, not with the view of excluding others, but because, in proportion as any one is joined to us in God, we ought to embrace him the more closely with special affection. True love, therefore, will extend to mankind universally, because they all are our flesh, and <em>created in the image of God</em>, (<span class="bvs">Gen_9:6</span>;) but in respect of degrees, it will begin with those who are of the <em>household of faith</em>. (<span class="bvs">Gal_6:10</span>.) </p></div>
