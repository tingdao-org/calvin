<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但他们得平安之后，又在你面前行恶，所以你丢弃他们在仇敌的手中，使仇敌辖制他们。然而他们转回哀求你，你仍从天上垂听，屡次照你的怜悯拯救他们。</div></div>
