<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>So the officers came. </em>Here we may see how blind is the arrogance of men. To such an extent do they admire and adore the greatness which renders them eminent, that they have no hesitation in trampling under foot morality and religion. If any thing happen contrary to their wish, they would willingly mingle heaven and earth; for when these haughty and wicked priests <span class="cite-ref">(202)</span> ask, <em>why Christ was not brought</em>, they magnify their power so greatly as if nothing ought to oppose their command. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(202)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Ces orgueilleur et mechans sacrificateurs</span>.” </p></div></div>
