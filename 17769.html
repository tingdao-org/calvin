<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们要吼叫像母狮子，咆哮像少壮狮子。他们要咆哮抓食，坦然叼去，无人救回。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>29.</strong><em>His roaring shall be like that of a lion. </em>This denotes fierceness and cruelty, for he compares the Chaldeans to <em>lions</em>, which, we know, are frightful to behold, and savage by nature; as if he had said that they would not be men who were moved by any feeling of compassion or tenderness, but rather that they would be savage beasts. He adds, that they will likewise possess great strength, so that none will venture to approach for rescuing their prey. He means that the Jews will have no defense for warding off their attacks, because the dread of their cruelty will keep all at a distance from them. It was God who employed their agency in punishing the Jews, and therefore it was necessary that they should be armed with formidable power, that this wayward people might at length acknowledge that they had to do not with men but with </p><p>God, into whose hands it is a fearful thing to fall.<LineBreak />(<span class="bvs">Heb_10:31</span>.) </p></div>
