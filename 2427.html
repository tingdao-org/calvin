<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我分派但支派中，亚希撒抹的儿子亚何利亚伯与他同工。凡心里有智慧的，我更使他们有智慧，能作我一切所吩咐的，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab</em>. It is no matter of surprise that the principal workman should be chosen from the tribe of Judah; <span class="cite-ref">(291)</span> why a companion should be given him from the tribe of Dan can hardly be accounted for, unless its obscurity more highly illustrated the grace of God. </p><p>A kind of contradiction at first sight appears, when it is added immediately afterwards that God had put wisdom in the hearts of all that were wise-hearted; for, if they already excelled in intelligence, what was the object of this new inspiration? Hence it has been commonly supposed, that the special grace of God was only given in aid of that ability which we naturally possess. But rather are we taught by this passage that, when anything grows in us, and our endowments manifest themselves more conspicuously, our progress is only derived from the continued operation of the Spirit. God had already conferred acuteness and intelligence on the artificers in question; yet their dexterity was only, as it were, the seed; and He now promises that He will give them more than had previously appeared. I know that the words may be thus explained, — Whosoever shall be fit and proper for the work, have therefore been endowed with intelligence, because God has inspired it by His secret influence; but the other exposition is more simple. What follows as to the various parts of the tabernacle has been already treated of elsewhere. </p><p><strong>(291)</strong> Addition in <em>Fr</em>. , “Laquelle estoit la premiere en dignite;” which was the highest in dignity. </p></div>
