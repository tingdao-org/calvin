<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>And all that make ponds. </em>As to the word <span class="lang he-il">שכר</span>, (<em>secher,</em>) there is no absolute necessity, in my opinion, for translating it <em>a net; </em>for the derivation shews it, on the contrary, to denote a lucrative occupation. <span class="cite-ref">(34)</span></p><p>Where fishes are very abundant, they are also preserved in pools and ponds; because the fishers would otherwise be constrained to sell them at a very low price. Besides, when they throw a net, they are not always successful. He therefore follows out the same subject, “It will not be possible either to take or to preserve fishes. Pools will be of no use.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(34)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
