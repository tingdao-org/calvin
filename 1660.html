<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我与他们坚定所立的约，要把他们寄居的迦南地赐给他们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And I have also established my covenant. </em>The hope of the deliverance which He had formerly promised, and which the Patriarchs had expected, He confirms by alluding to the covenant, as I have just above said; and the particle <span class="lang he-il">גם</span>, <em>gam</em>, which is twice repeated, is, in the first case, <em>causal</em>, in the second, <em>illative</em>, as much as to say, “Since I covenanted with your fathers, therefore I have now determined to bring you into the land of Canaan;” unless it be preferred to resolve it thus, “I, the same who established the covenant with your fathers, now also have heard your groaning.” Moreover, because the covenant is founded on free grace, God commands the redemption to be expected as much from His good pleasure as from His steadfastness. But He again commends the faith of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they patiently consented to be strangers and pilgrims in the land of Canaan, which by the covenant of God was their own lawful inheritance. For it was a proof of their exemplary virtue, to be wanderers all their lives, and not to have a single corner to put their foot upon, unless what was granted them by sufferance for the erection of their tents, being at the mercy of their neighbors; as natives are always apt to despise strangers. And by this comparison the slowness of heart and ingratitude of their posterity is the more condemned, if they refuse to take possession of this land, which was so earnestly desired by their holy fathers, and at the sight of which alone they counted themselves blessed, although they were only sojourners there. </p></div>
