<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚伯拉罕说，我儿，神必自己预备作燔祭的羊羔。于是二人同行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>So they went both of them together</em>. Here we perceive both the constancy of Abraham, and the modesty of his son. For Abraham is not rendered more remiss by this obstacles and the son does not persist in replying to his father’s answer. For he might easily have objected, Wherefore have we brought wood and the knife without a lamb, if God has commanded sacrifices to be made to him? But because he supposes that the victim has been omitted, for some valid reason, and not through his father’s forgetfulness, he acquiesces, and is silent. </p></div>
