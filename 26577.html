<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">所以耶稣不再显然行在犹太人中间，就离开那里往靠近旷野的地方去。到了一座城，名叫以法莲，就在那里和门徒同住。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>54.</strong><em>Which is called Ephraim. </em>As to the name of the town which is mentioned here, I think that either it was pronounced at that time in a corrupted manner, or it was entirely new. For we know how greatly the language was changed after the captivity into Babylon, and likewise how different was the appearance of the country; so that we need not be surprised that some places are mentioned, which in ancient times were altogether unknown. </p><p><em>And there he dwelt with his disciples. </em>By calling them <em>disciples of Christ</em>, he means not those who had received his doctrine, but those who were his constant companions, and who were wont to live under the same roof. </p></div>
