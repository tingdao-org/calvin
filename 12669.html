<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当日，派人管理库房，将举祭，初熟之物，和所取的十分之一，就是按各城田地，照律法所定归给祭司和利未人的分，都收在里头。犹大人因祭司和利未人供职，就欢乐了。</div></div>
