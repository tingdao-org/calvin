<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王预备甘心献的燔祭或平安祭，就是向耶和华甘心献的，当有人为他开朝东的门。他就预备燔祭和平安祭，与安息日预备的一样，献毕就出去。他出去之后，当有人将门关闭。</div></div>
