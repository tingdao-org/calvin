<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">过了这几天，我们就起身前行。他们众人同妻子儿女，送我们到城外，我们都跪在岸上祷告，彼此辞别。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>With their wives and children. </em>This was no small testimony of love, in that they accompanied Paul out of the city with their wives and children, which thing Luke doth report, partly that he might commend their godliness according as it deserved; partly that he might declare that Paul had that honor given him which was due to him. Whence we do also gather, that he meant nothing less than to provide for his own commodity, seeing that he was not kept back with so great good will, which was a pleasant bait to entice him to stay. And we must also note the solemn custom of praying in weightier affairs, and that being certified by God of the danger, they are more stirred up to pray. </p></div>
