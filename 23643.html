<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>But in vain do they worship me </em>The words of the prophet run literally thus: <em>their fear toward me has been taught by the precept of men. </em>But Christ has faithfully and accurately given the meaning, that <em>in vain is God worshipped, </em>when the will of men is substituted in the room of doctrine. By these words, all kinds of <em>will-worship, </em>( <span class="lang el-gr">ἐθελοθζησκεία</span>,) as Paul calls it, ( <span class="bvs">Col_2:23</span>,) are plainly condemned. For, as we have said, since God chooses to be worshipped in no other way than according to his own appointment, he cannot endure new modes of worship to be devised. As soon as men allow themselves to wander beyond the limits of the Word of God, the more labor and anxiety they display in worshipping him, the heavier is the condemnation which they draw down upon themselves; for by such inventions religion is dishonored. </p><p><em>Teaching doctrines, commandments of men </em>In these words there is what is called <em>apposition; </em><span class="cite-ref">(402)</span> for Christ declares them to be mistaken who bring forward, in the room of <em>doctrine, the commandments of men, </em>or who seek to obtain from them the rule for worshipping God. Let it therefore be held as a settled principle, that, since <em>obedience </em>is more highly esteemed by God than <em>sacrifices, </em>(<span class="bvs">1Sa_15:22</span>,) all kinds of worship invented by men are of no estimation in his sight; nay more, that, as the prophet declares, they are accursed and detestable. </p><p><strong>(402)</strong> “ C’est une figure et facon de parler que les Latins nomment Apposition;” — “it is a figure and mode of speech which the Latins call Apposition.” — “The Latin Grammarians employ the word <em>Appositio </em> to denote a figure, by which two words, denoting the same thing, are put in the same case, such as, <em>Urbs Roma, Fluvius Sequana </em> In the same sense the Greek word <span class="lang el-gr">ἐπεξήγησις</span> was often used. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
