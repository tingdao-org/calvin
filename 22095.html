<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你且去等候结局，因为你必安歇。到了末期，你必起来，享受你的福分。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the angel repeats what he had said before, the, full time of perfect light had not yet arrived, because God wished to hold the minds of his people in suspense until the manifestation of Christ. The angel, therefore, dismisses the Prophet, and in commanding him to depart, says — Be content with thy lot, for God wishes to put off the complete manifestation of this prophecy to another time, which he himself knows to be the fitting one. He afterwards adds, <em>And then shalt rest and shalt stand </em>Others translate it, <em>rest and stand; </em>but the angel does not seem to me to command or order what he wishes to be done, but to announce future events, as if he had said, — Thou shalt rest, meaning, thou shalt die, and then thou shalt stand; meaning, thy death shall not be complete destruction. For God shall cause thee to stand in thy lot with the rest of the elect; <em>and that, too, at the end of the days, in thy lot; </em>that is, after God has sufficiently proved the patience of his people, and by long and numerous, nay, infinite contests, has humbled his Church, and purged it, until the end shall arrive<em>. At that final period thou shalt stand in thine own lot, </em>although a time of repose must necessarily intervene. </p></div>
