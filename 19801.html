<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华如此说，若是我立白日黑夜的约不能存住，若是我未曾安排天地的定例，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here God opposes the constancy of his faithfulness to their perverse murmurings, of which he had complained; and he again adduces the similitude previously brought forward: <em>“lf, </em>then, I <em>have not fixed my covenant, </em>or if there is no covenant <em>as to the day and the night, </em>—<em>if there are no laws as to heaven and earth, then I shall now cast away the seed of Jacob and the seed of David: </em>but if my constancy is ever conspicuous as to the laws of nature, how is it that ye ascribe not to me my due honor? For I am the same God, who created the heaven and the earth, who fixed all the laws of nature which remain unchangeable, and who also have made a covenant with my Church. If my faithfulness as to the laws of nature changes not, wily should it change as to that sacred covenant which I have made with my chosen people?” </p><p>We now see the reason why God so often confirmed a thing in itself sufficiently clear, even because the contest with the obstinate hopelessness of the people was difficult. For they thought that they were rejected without any hope of deliverance, when God punished them only for a time for their wickedness, as they deemed their exile to be without a return. </p></div>
