<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他两个儿子以撒，以实玛利把他埋葬在麦比拉洞里。这洞在幔利前，赫人琐辖的儿子以弗仑的田中，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him</em>. Hence it appears, that although Ishmael had long ago been dismissed, he was not utterly alienated from his father, because he performed the office of a son in celebrating the obsequies of his deceased parent. Ishmael, rather than the other sons did this, as being nearer. </p></div>
