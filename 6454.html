<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">乃是为你我中间和你我后人中间作证据，好叫我们也在耶和华面前献燔祭，平安祭，和别的祭事奉他，免得你们的子孙日后对我们的子孙说，你们与耶和华无分了。</div></div>
