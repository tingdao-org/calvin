<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们去为我，为以色列和犹大剩下的人，以这书上的话求问耶和华。因我们列祖没有遵守耶和华的言语，没有照这书上所记的去行，耶和华的烈怒就倒在我们身上。</div></div>
