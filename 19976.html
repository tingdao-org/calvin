<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为尼探雅的儿子以实玛利杀了巴比伦王所立为省长的亚希甘的儿子基大利，约哈难惧怕迦勒底人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He then says, that they were there for a time, but that they looked forward to Egypt, on <em>account, </em>he says, <em>of the Chaldeans, </em>because they feared them, and for this reason, <em>because Ishmael had killed Gedaliah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had set over the land </em>This fear was not without reason; but they might have sent persons to the king of Babylon, and have thrown the blame on the right person, and cleared themselves; and the matter might have been settled. They might then have easily obtained pardon from King Nebuchadnezzar; but as no fear of God prevailed in them, they did not consider what was lawful, and were by a blind impulse led into Egypt. Thus fear was no alleviation to their crime, for there was another remedy at hand, which God would have blessed. But when they disregarded God’s word, and followed what their own feelings dictated to them, they contrived in a very bad way for themselves. But far worse is what follows. </p></div>
