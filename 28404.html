<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">只有神借着圣灵向我们显明了。因为圣灵参透万事，就是神深奥的事也参透了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>But God hath revealed them to us. </em>Having shut up all mankind in blindness, and having taken away from the human intellect the power of attaining to a knowledge of God by its own resources, he now shows in what way believers are exempted from this blindness, — by the Lord’s honoring them with a special illumination of the Spirit. Hence the greater the bluntness of the human intellect for understanding the mysteries of God, and the greater the uncertainty under which it labors, so much the surer is our faith, which rests for its support on the revelation of God’s Spirit. In this, too, we recognize the unbounded goodness of God, who makes our defect contribute to our advantage. </p><p><em>For the Spirit searcheth all things </em>This is added for the consolation of the pious, that they may rest more securely in the revelation which they have from the Spirit of God, as though he had said. “Let it suffice us to have the Spirit of God as a witness, for there is nothing in God that is too profound for him to reach.” For such is the import here of the word <em>searcheth </em>By the <em>deep things </em>you must understand — not secret judgments, which we are forbidden to <em>search into</em>, but the entire doctrine of salvation, which would have been to no purpose set before us in the Scriptures, were it not that God elevates our minds to it by his Spirit. </p></div>
