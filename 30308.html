<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">若是弟兄，或是姐妹，赤身露体，又缺了日用的饮食，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>If a brother</em>, or, <em>For if a brother</em>. He takes an example from what was connected with his subject; for he had been exhorting them to exercise the duties of love. If any one, on the contrary, boasted that he was satisfied with faith without works, he compares this shadowy faith to the saying of one who bids a famished man to be filled without supplying him with the food of which he is destitute. As, then, he who sends away a poor man with words, and offers him no help, treats him with mockery, so they who devise for themselves faith without works, and without any of the duties of religion, trifle with God. <span class="cite-ref">(114)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(114)</span> This is adduced as an illustration: as the saying of a man to the naked, “Be ye clothed,” when he does nothing, effects no good, is wholly useless, so is that faith that produces no works; it being as it were dead, it cannot save. </p></div></div>
