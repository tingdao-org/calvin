<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你吃这祭牲，不可吃有酵的饼。七日之内要吃无酵饼，就是困苦饼。（你本是急忙出了埃及地）要叫你一生一世记念你从埃及地出来的日子。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Deu_16:3</span><em>Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it. </em>Because by this sign they were reminded of their having escaped in haste, as it were from the very flames; therefore does Moses so often enforce the prohibition of leaven. And here this reason for it is alleged, viz., that their recollection should be recalled to the affliction from which they were rescued; for they must needs have been involved in the greatest straits, when there was no time even for baking bread. Unleavened bread is therefore called “the bread of affliction,” that the manner of their deliverance may the more enhance God’s grace. He repeats what we have seen before, that none of the flesh of the Lamb should be reserved to the following day. In the former passage from the Book of Exodus, because Moses speaks generally, the command may at first sight be referred to the perpetual sacrifice; but the latter passage takes away all obscurity, by the express mention of the passover. We need not wonder that in one place the word “fat” is used for the whole carcase, or any part of the lamb, either by <em>synecdoche, </em>or that God might commend the superior sanctity of the fat, of which they were not permitted to eat, and which was burnt in all sacrifices. </p></div>
