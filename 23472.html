<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">从施洗约翰的时候到如今，天国是努力进入的，努力的人就得着了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12.</strong><em>Since the days of John </em>I have no doubt that Christ speaks honorably of the majesty of the Gospel on this ground, that many sought after it with warm affection; for as God had raised up John to be the herald of the kingdom of his Son, so the Spirit infused such efficacy into his doctrine, that it entered deeply into the hearts of men and kindled that zeal. It appears, therefore, that the Gospel, which comes forward in a manner so sudden and extraordinary, <span class="cite-ref">(16)</span> and awakens powerful emotions, must have proceeded from God. But in the second clause is added this restriction, that <em>the violent take it by force </em>The greater part of men were no more excited than if the Prophets had never uttered a word about Christ, or if John had never appeared as his witness; and therefore Christ reminds them, that the <em>violence, </em>of which he had spoken, existed only in men of a particular class. The meaning therefore is, A vast assembly of men is now collected, as if men were rushing <em>violently </em>forward to seize <em>the kingdom of God; </em>for, aroused by the voice of one man, they come together in crowds, and receive, not only with eagerness, but with vehement impetuosity, the grace which is offered to them. Although very many are asleep, and are no more affected than if John in the wilderness were acting a play which had no reference to them, yet many flock to him with ardent zeal. The tendency of our Lord’s statement is to show, that those who pass by in a contemptuous manner, and as it were with closed eyes, the power of God, which manifestly appears both in the teacher and in the hearers, are inexcusable. Let us also learn from these words, what is the true nature and operation of faith. It leads men not only to give, cold and indifferent assent when God speaks, but to cherish warm affection towards Him, and to rush forward as it were with a violent struggle. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(16)</span> ”<span class="lang fr-fr">Laquelle tant soudainement gaigne les coeurs des hommes d’une facon non accoustumee, et y cause des mouvemens merveilleux</span>;” — “which so suddenly gains the hearts of men in an unusual manner, and excites in them wonderful emotions.” </p></div></div>
