<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>On looking to the right hand</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(247)</span><em>etc</em>. , He shows that there was good cause for the dreadful sufferings he experienced, since no human aid or comfort was to be expected, and destruction seemed inevitable. When he speaks of having looked and yet not perceived a friend amongst men, he does not mean that he had turned his thoughts to earthly helps in forgetfulness of God, but that he had made such inquiry as was warrantable after one on the earth who might assist him. Had any person of the kind presented himself, he would no doubt have recognized him as an instrument in the hand of God’s mercy, but it was God’s purpose that he should be abandoned of all assistance from man, and that his deliverance from destruction should thus appear more extraordinary. In the expression, <em>none seeking after my soul</em>, the verb to <em>seek after </em>is used in a good sense, for being solicitous about any man’s welfare or safety. </p><p><strong>(247)</strong> The allusion here, it is supposed, is to the observances of the ancient Jewish courts of judicature, in which the advocate, as well as the accuser, stood on the <em>right hand </em>of the accused. (<span class="bvs">Psa_109:5</span>.) The Psalmist felt himself in the condition of one who had nobody to plead his cause, and to protect him in the dangerous circumstances in which he was placed. </p></div>
