<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">叫余剩的人，就是凡称为我名下的外邦人，都寻求主。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>That those which remain may seek. </em>James added this word <em>seek </em>by way of exposition, which is not found nor read in the prophet; and yet it is not superfluous, because, to the end we may be numbered among the people of God, and that he may take us for his own, we must, on the other side, [in our turn,] be encouraged to seek him. And it is to be thought that Luke did summarily comprehend those things whereof James did dispute in his own language among the Jews; whereby it came to pass that the exposition of the matter was mixed with the words of the prophet. Instead of the <em>relics of the Gentiles </em>which Amos useth, Luke, out of the Greek translation, (which was more familiar,) putteth the <em>rest of the men </em>in the same sense, to wit, that there must go before the purging of the filthiness of the world a cutting, or paring, as it came to pass. And this doctrine must be also applied unto our time. For, because the corruption of the world is worse than that it can be wholly brought to obey Christ, he bloweth away, with diverse fans of tribulations, the chaff and weeds, that he may at length gather unto himself that which shall remain.</p></div>
