<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣对他说，西门，我有句话要对你说。西门说，夫子，请说。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>And Jesus answering said. </em>By this reply Christ shows how egregiously Simon was mistaken. Exposing to public view his silent and concealed thought, he proves himself to possess something more excellent than what belonged to the <em>Prophets; </em>for he does not reply to his words, but refutes the sentiment which he kept hidden within his breast. Nor was it only on Simon’s account that this was done, but in order to assure every one of us, that we have no reason to fear lest any sinner be rejected by him, who not only gives them kind and friendly invitations, but is prepared with equal liberality, and—as we might say—with outstretched arms, to receive them all. </p></div>
