<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶稣说了这话，随后对他们说，我们的朋友拉撒路睡了，我去叫醒他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>Our friend Lazarus sleepeth. </em>Having formerly asserted that the disease was not deadly, that his disciples may not be too much distressed at seeing what they did not expect, he now informs them also that Lazarus is dead, and excites a hope of his resurrection. It is a proof of amazing ignorance, that they believe that Christ spoke about <em>sleep</em>; for, though it is a metaphorical form of expression, still it is so frequent and common in Scripture, that it ought to have been familiarly known to all the Jews. </p></div>
