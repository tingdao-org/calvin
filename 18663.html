<div class="CUV verse">并且我必使那欺压你的吃自己的肉，也要以自己的血喝醉，好像喝甜酒一样。凡有血气的，必都知道我耶和华是你的救主，是你的救赎主，是雅各的大能者。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>26.</strong><em>And I will feed thy oppressors with their own flesh. </em>First, he declares what is the nature of that end which awaits the enemies of the Church, and threatens that they shall not only be inflamed with mutual hatred, but shall likewise slay each other by mutual slaughter. And indeed it is God who drives them headlong, and rouses them to rage, so that they tum against themselves that strength which they formerly exerted against the Church, fight with each other, as the Midianites did, and bring destruction on themselves. (<span class="bvs">Jud_7:22</span>.) The meaning amounts to this, that there will be no need of outward aid or of any preparations, when God shall determine to overtum and destroy the reprobate; because, having been struck by him with giddiness, they shall wear themselves out in mutual conflict by the insatiable rage with which they shall attack each other. </p><p><em>And all flesh shall know. </em>He repeats that statement which we have formerly seen, namely, that he will be acknowledged by all to be the God of Israel and the true and only God, when he shall have delivered his people from destruction; for he intended it to be a demonstration of his Divinity, that he openly manifested himself to be the Redeemer and Savior of his people. </p><p><em>The Mighty One of Jacob. </em>Some read the word <em>Jacob </em>in the vocative case: “O mighty Jacob;” but I read it in the genitive case, “of Jacob.” The Lord testifies that he is the Savior, Redeemer, and Mighty One of Israel, that they may rely with their whole heart on his defense and protection. </p></div>
