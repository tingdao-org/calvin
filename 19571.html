<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">听阿，有牧人呼喊，有群众头目哀号的声音，因为耶和华使他们的草场变为荒场。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He not merely repeats the same thing in other words, but adds also something more grievous, that God would render desolate their pastures. He pursues the same metaphor; for as he used this comparison in speaking of the king’s counsellors and the priests, so now he does the same; and what he means by pastures is the community, the people, in the city and in the country; <span class="cite-ref">(154)</span> as though he had said, that they had hitherto ruled over that land which was rich and fertile, and in which they enjoyed power and dignity, but that now they would be deprived of all these benefits. He afterwards adds, — </p><p><strong>(154)</strong> So the Targ. renders the sentence, “For the Lord hath destroyed their people.” — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
