<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华阿，你向来是照你的话善待仆人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>65.</strong><em>O Jehovah! thou hast done good to thy servant. </em>Some understand this generally, as if the prophet protested that, in whatever way God dealt with him, he took it in good part, convinced that it would ultimately issue in his welfare; but as express mention is made of the Divine word or promise, the prophet, I have no doubt, celebrates the faithfulness of God in performing the grace which he had promised. I have really experienced (as if he had said) that Thou art true, and dost not delude thy servants with empty words. Special reference is therefore here made to God’s promises, because thence all his benefits flow to us, not, indeed, as from the original fountain-head, but, as it were, by conduit pipes. Although his free goodness is the only cause which induces him to deal bountifully with us, yet we can hope for nothing at his hand until he first bring himself under obligation to us by his word. </p></div>
