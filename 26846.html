<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">犹太人的祭司长，就对彼拉多说，不要写犹太人的王。要写他自己说我是犹太人的王。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>The chief priests of the Jews said therefore to Pilate. </em>They feel that they are sharply rebuked; and, therefore, they would wish that <em>the title </em>were changed, so as not to involve the nation in disgrace, but to throw the whole blame on Christ. But yet they do not conceal their deep hatred of the truth, since the smallest spark of it is more than they are able to endure. Thus Satan always prompts his servants to endeavor to extinguish, or, at least, to choke, by their own darkness, the light of God, as soon as the feeblest ray of it appears. </p></div>
