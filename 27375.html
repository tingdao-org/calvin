<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong>Here is set down another of Paul’s stations; for, being departed from Paphos, when he came to Antioch of Pisidia, he made there a worthy <span class="cite-ref">(791)</span> sermon, which Luke will recite, together with the success; but before he come to that, he doth by the way speak of the departure of John, because it was afterwards a cause of doleful disagreement. When he saith, <em>Paul’s companions loosed from Paphos, </em>he doth, in the first place, mean Paul himself; secondly, the other, one excepted. So that by noting his softness, he praiseth others which followed Paul with great <span class="cite-ref">(792)</span> constancy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(791)</span> “Memorabilem,” memorable. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(792)</span> “Indefatigabili,” indefatigable. </p></div></div>
