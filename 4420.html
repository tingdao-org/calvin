<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">巴兰对巴勒说，你站在你的燔祭旁边，我且往前去，或者耶和华来迎见我。他指示我什么，我必告诉你。于是巴兰上一净光的高处。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>And Balaam said unto Balak. </em>In this respect, also, he imitates the true servants of God: for he seeks retirement, because God has almost always appeared unto His servants when they have been separated from the company of men. You would say that he was another Moses, when he exhorts the king to persevering prayer, and, in order that he may be more earnest in supplication, bids him remain perfectly still by the altars. Meanwhile he withdraws himself from the crowd, and the eyes of the witnesses, so that he may be more ready to receive the revelation. Since, however, there was no sincerity in him, we may probably conclude, that in vain ostentation he imitated the servants of God, that, like one of God’s councillors, he might bring forth the secrets from the shrines of heaven. I know not why some render the word <span class="lang he-il">שפי</span>, <em>shephi, alone, </em>others, <em>sad; </em><span class="cite-ref">(155)</span> it is more suitable to take it for <em>a high place; </em>which other similar passages confirm. The impostor, therefore, retired into a higher place, or summit, in order that he might come forth from thence more surely established as a prophet by his familiar intercourse with God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(155)</span><em>A.V. </em>“an high place.” <em>Margin, </em>“he went solitary.” “Onkelos explains the word <span class="lang he-il">שפי</span> as <span class="lang he-il">יחידי</span><em>alone; </em>but Kimchi interprets it as <span class="lang he-il">גכוח</span> a <em>high place. </em>Rabbi Jehuda expounds is it as <span class="lang he-il">נשבר</span><em>affected with grief; etc.” </em>—<em>S.M. </em>There is a curious error in the <em>Fr., </em>evidently arising from its dictation to an amanuensis, “le mot que j’ay translate <em>Amen,” i.e., “a mont,” </em>as it stands in the <em>Fr</em>. Text. </p></div></div>
