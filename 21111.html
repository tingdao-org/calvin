<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因他的马匹众多，尘土扬起遮蔽你。他进入你的城门，好像人进入已有破口之城。那时，你的墙垣必因骑马的和战车，辎重车的响声震动。</div></div>
