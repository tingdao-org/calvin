<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>For one is your Master, even Christ. </em>He repeats a second time the former statement about Christ’s office as <em>Master, </em>in order to inform us that the lawful order is, that God alone rule over us, and possess the power and authority of a <em>Father, </em>and that Christ subject all to his doctrine, and have them as disciples; as it is elsewhere said, that Christ is the only </p><p>head of the whole Church, (<span class="bvs">Eph_1:22</span>) </p><p>because the whole body ought to be subject to him and obey him. </p></div>
