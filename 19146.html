<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>He afterwards subjoins, <em>And they hearkened not </em>There is here a change of person; for he said in the last verse, “<em>your </em>fathers,” “I sent to <em>you</em>; ” but now he says, <em>They hearkened not, nor inclined their ear </em>It is indeed true, that the reference is to the fathers; but in the next verse God includes the people who were then living. There is then no doubt but that it was an evidence of indignation, that he changed the person, and that he was wearied in addressing them, for he saw that he spoke in vain to a stupid people: and this will appear evident from the next verse. <em>They hearkened not, </em>he says, <em>nor inclined their ear </em>The words we have already explained: the Jews are here precluded from having any excuse on the ground of error or ignorance; for they had refused to be taught, they would not attend, but on the contrary made deaf their cars. And he says also, that they <em>hardened their neck</em>; by which their perverseness is still more fully expressed: they designedly as it were despised God, and carried on war even with his favor and kindness. And he concludes by saying, that they had <em>done worse than their fathers </em>He had said, “your fathers;” but now, “their fathers.” We hence see that the sentence is changed, for God knew that he could produce no effect on them, as we find by what follows — </p></div>
