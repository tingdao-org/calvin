<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">使海与深渊的水干涸，使海的深处变为赎民经过之路的，不是你吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Which dried up the sea. </em>Though Isaiah does not relate all the miracles which God performed when he brought out his people from the bondage of Egypt, yet he intended to include in a few words all that are related by Moses, that the Jews, having been briefly addressed, might consider the various ways in which the Lord had demonstrated his power. The drying up of the Red Sea is mentioned, not only on account of the extraordinary excellence of the miracle, but because the numerous miracles which preceeded it were directed to this end, that the people, rescued from unjust violence and tyranny, might pass into the promised land. Accordingly, the Prophet expressly mentions that <em>a way was opened up for the redeemed. </em>From this example we ought to consider what God will be to us, so as to draw this conclusion, that in future God will always be like himself, as is evident from the context. </p></div>
