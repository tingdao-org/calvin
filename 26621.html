<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">以赛亚因为看见他的荣耀，就指着他说这话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong><em>These things spoke Jesus. </em>Lest readers should think that this prediction was inappropriately quoted, John expressly states, that the prophet was not sent as a teacher to a single age, but, on the contrary, that the glory of Christ was exhibited to him, that he might be a witness of those things which should take place under his reign. Now the Evangelist takes for granted, that Isaiah saw the glory of Christ; and hence he infers, that Isaiah accommodates his instruction to the future state of Christ’s kingdom. </p></div>
