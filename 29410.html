<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19</strong><em>But I hope</em>. He promises them the coming of Timothy, that, from their expecting him, they may bear up more courageously, and not give way to impostors. For as in war an expectation of help animates soldiers, so as to keep them from giving way, so this consideration, too, was fitted to encourage greatly the Philippians: “There will one come very shortly, who will set himself in opposition to the contrivances of our enemies.” But if the mere expectation of him had so much influence, his presence would exert a much more powerful effect. We must take notice of the condition <span class="cite-ref">(144)</span> — in respect of which he submits himself to the providence of God, forming no purpose, but with <em>that </em>leading the way, as assuredly it is not allowable to determine anything as to the future, except, so to speak, under the Lord’s hand. When he adds, <em>that I may be in tranquillity</em>, he declares his affection towards them, inasmuch as he was so much concerned as to their dangers, that he was not at ease until he received accounts of their prosperity. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(144)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En ces mots, </span><em class="lang fr-fr">au Seigneur Jesus</em><span class="lang fr-fr">, il faut noter la condition</span>;” — “In these words, <em>in the Lord Jesus</em>, we must notice the condition.” </p></div></div>
