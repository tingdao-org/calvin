<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我要在耶和华面前，行活人之路。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>I will walk in the presence of Jehovah. To wall in the presence of God is, </em>in my opinion, equivalent to living under his charge. And thus David expects to enjoy his safety continually. For nothing is more desirable than that God should be upon the watch for us, that our life may be surrounded by his protecting care. The wicked, indeed, regard themselves as secure, the farther they are from God; but the godly consider themselves happy in this one thing, that he directs the whole tenor of their life. God adding, <em>in the land of the living, </em>he means to point out to us the course that we are expected to pursue; and that, almost every moment of time, fresh destructions press upon us, if he overlook us. </p></div>
