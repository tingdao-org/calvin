<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人上那里去，必带弓箭，因为遍地满了荆棘和蒺藜。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>With arrows and bow shall they come thither. </em>The verb <span class="lang he-il">יבא</span>, (<em>yabo</em>,) <em>he shall come</em>, is in the singular number; but it ought to be explained by the plural, that the archers will march through Judea. Some think that Isaiah speaks of <em>bows and arrows</em>, because such would be the dread of enemies, that no man unarmed would venture to approach his possessions. But I consider it to be more probable that the Prophet means that, where the richest cultivation formerly existed, opportunity for hunting will be found; for there the wild beasts have their dens. Now, it is a most wretched change, when fields formerly cultivated and fertile are turned into woods and thickets. By <em>bow and arrow </em>here, therefore, I understand <em>hunting</em>, in this sense: “it shall not be approached by husbandmen but by hunters, and they shall not plant or dress vines, but chase wild beasts.” In short, it means nothing else than frightful desolation, which shall change the aspect of the land. </p></div>
