<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">约书亚穿着污秽的衣服，站在使者面前。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Zechariah adds here another thing, — that Joshua had on mean garments, but that new garments were given him by the angel’s command. And by this he means, that though the priesthood had been for a time contemptible, it would yet recover whatever dignity it had lost. But he ever leads the minds of the faithful to this point, — to look for what they did not then see, nor could conjecture from the state of things at that time. It is certain that the sacerdotal vestments, after the return from exile, were not such as they were before; for they were not sumptuously woven, nor had attached to them so many precious stones. Though Cyrus had bountifully supplied great abundance of gold and silver for the worship of God, yet the chief priest did not so shine with precious stones and the work of the Phrygians as before the exile. Hence, what was shown to Zechariah was then well known to all. But we ought to notice the latter clause, — that the angel commanded a change of garments. The Prophet then bids the faithful to be of good cheer, though the appearance of the priesthood was vile and mean, because God would not overlook its contemptible state; but the time of restoration had not yet come; when it came, the ancient dignity of the priesthood would again appear. </p><p>With regard to the words, the first thing to be observed is the fact, that Joshua <em>stood before the angel</em>, having on <em>sordid </em>or torn <em>garments </em><span class="cite-ref">(37)</span> The repetition seems to be without reason; for he had said before that Joshua stood before the angel of God. Why then does he now repeat that he stood before the angel? That the faithful might take courage; because it was God’s evident purpose that the chief priest should remain there in his sordid garments; for we think that God forgets us when he does not immediately succor us, or when things are in a confused state. Hence Zechariah meets his doubt by saying, that Joshua stood before the angel. He further reminded them, that though the whole world should despise the priesthood, it was yet under the eyes of God. Conspicuous were other priests in the eyes of men, and attracted the admiring observation of all, as it is well known; but all heathen priesthoods, we know, were of no account before God. Hence though heathen priesthoods shone before men, they were yet abominations only in the sight of God; but the priesthood of Joshua, however abject and vile it may have been, was yet, as Zechariah testifies, esteemed before God. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(37)</span> The word, [<span class="lang he-il">צואים</span> ], does not mean what is shabby, mean, or tattered, but what is filthy,dirty, as opposed to what is clean. Our version, “filthy,” adopted by <em>Newcome </em>and <em>Henderson</em>, is the most suitable. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div></div>
