<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但那安慰丧气之人的神，借着提多来安慰了我们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>Who comforteth the lowly. </em>This is mentioned as a reason; for he means that consolation had been offered to him, because he was borne down with evils, and almost overwhelmed, inasmuch as God is wont to <em>comfort the lowly, </em>that is, those that are cast down. Hence a most profitable doctrine may be inferred — that the more we have been afflicted, so much the greater consolation has been prepared for us by God. Hence, in the epithet here applied to God, there is a choice promise contained, as though he had said, that it is peculiarly the part of God to comfort those that are miserable and are abased to the dust. </p></div>
