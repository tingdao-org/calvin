<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>Jacob begat Judah and his brethren </em>While Matthew passes by in silence Ishmael, Abraham’s first-born, and Esau, who was Jacob’s elder brother, he properly assigns a place in the genealogy to the Twelve Patriarchs, on all of whom God had bestowed a similar favor of adoption. He therefore intimates, that the blessing promised in Christ does not refer to the tribe of Judah alone, but belongs equally to all the children of Jacob, whom God gathered into his Church, while Ishmael and Esau were treated as strangers. <span class="cite-ref">(88)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(88)</span> “Quum essent extranei.” — “<span class="lang fr-fr">En lieu qu'Ismael et Esau en avoyent este rejettez et bannis comme estrangers</span>.” — “Whereas Ishmael and Esau were thrown out and banished from it as strangers.” </p></div></div>
