<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我又转念，见日光之下，快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜，智慧的未必得粮食，明哲的未必得赀财，灵巧的未必得喜悦。所临到众人的，是在乎当时的机会。</div></div>
