<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们因你的怒气而消灭，因你的忿怒而惊惶。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7</strong><em>For we fail by thy anger. </em>Moses makes mention of the anger of God advisedly; for it is necessary that men be touched with the feeling of this, in order to their considering in good earnest, what experience constrains them to acknowledge, how soon they finish their course and pass away. He had, however, still another reason for joining together the brevity of human life and the anger of God. Whilst men are by nature so transitory, and, as it were, shadowy, the Israelites were afflicted by the hostile hand of God; and his anger is less supportable by our frail natures, which speedily vanish away, than it would be were we furnished with some tolerable degree of strength. </p></div>
