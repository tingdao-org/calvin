<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Have we not power </em>? He concludes from what has been already said, that he had a right to receive food and clothing from them, <span class="cite-ref">(482)</span> for Paul ate and drank, but not at the expense of the Church. This, then, was one liberty that he dispensed with. The other was, that he had not a wife — to be maintained, also, at the public expense. Eusebius infers from these words that Paul was married, but had left his wife somewhere, that she might not be a burden to the Churches, but there is no foundation for this, for he might bring forward this, even though unmarried. In honoring a Christian wife with the name of <em>sister</em>, he intimates, first of all, by this, how firm and lovely ought to be the connection between a pious pair, being held by a double tie. Farther he hints at the same time what modesty and honorable conduct ought to subsist between them. Hence, too, we may infer, how very far marriage is from being unsuitable to the ministers of the Church. I pass over the fact, that the Apostles made use of it, as to whose example we shall have occasion to speak ere long, but Paul here teaches, in general terms, what is allowable for all. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(482)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Combion qu’il n’en air pus use</span>;” — “Though he had not made use of it.” </p></div></div>
