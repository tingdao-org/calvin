(<span class="bvs">Jer_31:31</span>.) <span class="cite-ref">(145)</span> The new covenant succeeded the old as a reformation. He expressly mentions <em>meats </em>and <em>drinks, </em>and other things of minor importance, because by these trifling observances a more certain opinion may be formed how far short was the Law of the perfection of the Gospel. <span class="cite-ref">(146)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(145)</span> Although the original text in the book refers to <span class="bvs">Jer_31:37</span>, which warns of an ultimate rejection of Israel; it would seem that <span class="bvs">Jer_31:31</span> is more appropriate in the current context of reformation. — <em>fj</em>. ] </p><p><span class="cite-note">(146)</span> See Appendix G 2. </p></div></div>
