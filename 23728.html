<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但恐怕触犯他们，（触犯原文作绊倒）你且往海边去钓鱼，把先钓上来的鱼拿起来，开了它的口，必得一块钱，可以拿去给他们，作你我的税银。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>Throw a hook. </em>Though I acknowledge that Christ had not always full coffers, yet I think that he was not compelled by poverty to give this order to Peter, but that he did so in order to prove by a miracle, that he had a more extensive dominion than all earthly kings, since he had even <em>fishes </em>for his tributaries. And we do not read that this was done more than once, because one proof was enough for his whole life. <em>Thou wilt find a stater. A stater </em>was of the same value as a shekel, namely, four drachms or two didrachma. <span class="cite-ref">(583)</span></p><p><strong>(583)</strong> The <em>didrachmon </em>weighed <em>two drachms</em>, and the <em>stater</em>, which weighed <em>two didrachma</em>, or <em>four drachms</em>, was worth about two shillings and sixpence of our money. — Ed. </p></div>
