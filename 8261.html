<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">过了一年，到列王出战的时候，大卫又差派约押，率领臣仆和以色列众人出战。他们就打败亚扪人，围攻拉巴。大卫仍住在耶路撒冷。</div></div>
