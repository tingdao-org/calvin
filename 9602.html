<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">拆毁摩押的城邑，各人抛石填满一切美田，塞住一切水泉，砍伐各种佳树，只剩下吉珥哈列设的石墙。甩石的兵在四围攻打那城。</div></div>
