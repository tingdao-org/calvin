<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">亚西亚的众教会问你们安。亚居拉和百基拉，并在他们家里的教会，因主多多地问你们安。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>With the Church that is in their house </em>A magnificent eulogium, inasmuch as the name of the Church is applied to a single family! At the same time it is befitting, that all the families of the pious should be regulated in such a manner as to be so many little Churches. As to the term <em>Congregation, </em>which Erasmus has used in preference, it is foreign to Paul’s design; for it was not his intention to designate a crowd of persons by a mere common term, but to speak in honorable terms of the management of a Christian household. His saluting them in the name of Aquila and Priscilla, confirms what I have noticed above — that the Epistle was written at Ephesus, not at Philippi. For Luke informs us, that they remained at Ephesus, when Paul went elsewhere. (<span class="bvs">Act_18:19</span>.) </p></div>
