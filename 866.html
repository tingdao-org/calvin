<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he removed that day the he goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当日，拉班把有纹的，有斑的公山羊，有点的，有斑的，有杂白纹的母山羊，并黑色的绵羊，都挑出来，交在他儿子们的手下，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>35.</strong><em>And he removed that day</em>. From this verse the form of the compact is more certainly known. Laban separates the sheep and goats marked with spots from the pure flock, that is, from the white or black, and commits these to his sons to be fed; interposing a three-days’ journey between them and the rest; lest, by promiscuous intercourse, a particoloured offspring should be produced. It follows, therefore, that, in the flock which Jacob fed, nothing remained but cattle of one color: thus but faint hope of gain remained to the holy man, while every provision was made for Laban’s advantage. It also appears, from the distance of the places, in which Laban kept his flocks apart, that he was not less suspicious than covetous; for dishonest men are wont to measure others by their own standard; whence it happens that they are always distrustful and alarmed. </p></div>
