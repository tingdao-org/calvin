<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">倘若她丈夫天天向她默默不言，就算是坚定她所许的愿和约束自己的话。因丈夫听见的日子向她默默不言，就使这两样坚定。</div></div>
