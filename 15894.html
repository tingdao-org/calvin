<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这是耶和华所定的日子。我们在其中要高兴欢喜。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>This is the day which Jehovah made </em>He now speaks of that as a happy and pleasant day, on which he was at last established king over Israel, and the anointing of him by Samuel ratified by this event. Doubtless, all days were created alike by God, nevertheless David, by way of eminence, calls that <em>the day of God </em>which, after a long period of darkness, had dawned for the weal of the Church, because it was signalized by a notable event, deserving of being remembered by succeeding generations; and because the Church had thus emerged from a state of deep obscurity, he exhorts the faithful to mirth and joy, and that, too, by reason of the ignorance which many still displayed of the grace of God, or of their treating it with contempt, and of others being so lettered by their perverse attachment to Saul, that they could scarcely be brought to yield allegiance to David. </p></div>
