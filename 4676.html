<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">把一切所夺的，所掳的，连人带牲畜都带了去，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And they took all the spoil. </em>It was a sign both of their disinterestedness and modesty, that they brought the booty, which they had taken in the ardor of battle, to Moses and Eleazar; nor was it a mere empty and pompous ceremony, as many boastingly parade the wealth which they desire to keep to themselves; but their intention was, to acquiesce in the determination of Moses as to its distribution. For, when Moses soon afterwards allots half of it to the people, they are so far from rebelling against his decision, that they do not even murmur. It is clear, then, that in this respect they were no less submissive than they had been when, at the outset, they took up arms, and boldly went forth to battle, whilst the rest were quietly reposing out of the reach of the darts. </p></div>
