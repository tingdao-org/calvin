<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>And glorified God. </em>As to the people <em>glorifying God, </em>it is mentioned in order to inform us, that this was distinctly perceived to be a heavenly blessing. It was not some doubtful work which allowed room for argument on either side, but one which afforded ample and undoubted grounds for praising God. This discovers more strongly the malignity of the <em>ruler of the synagogue </em></p></div>
