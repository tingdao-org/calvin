<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们这使公平变为茵陈，将公义丢弃于地的，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet, after having inveighed against superstitions, comes to the second table of the law. The Prophets are sometimes wont to shake off self-complacencies from hypocrites, when they spread before God their external veils, by saying that all their ceremonies are useless, except accompanied with integrity of heart: but in this place the Prophet expressly condemns in the Israelites two things; that is, that they had corrupted the true worship of God, departed from the doctrine of the law, and polluted themselves with ungodly superstitions; and he also reprehends them for their wicked and dishonest conduct towards men, — for their disregard of what was right and equitable, — for plunder, cruelty, and fraud. This second subject the Prophet handles, when he says, that they <em>converted judgment into wormwood and allowed righteousness to fall on the ground. </em>But the rest I must defer till tomorrow. </p></div>
