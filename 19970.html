<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">就带领众人前往，要和尼探雅的儿子以实玛利争战，在基遍的大水旁（或作大水池旁）遇见他。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Here the Prophet informs us, that Ishmael did not attain his wishes; for he had resolved to sell; as it were, the people to the king of Ammon, but he was intercepted in his course. But he says first, that <em>John the son of Kareah </em>had <em>heard </em>the report, and that he, together with other leaders, went to meet him in order to intercept him in his journey. He says also that <em>he collected all the men, </em>even those who had been dispersed. All then they could have got, they enlisted, and went to fight with Ishmael. And the Prophet adds, that they <em>found him at the great waters </em>And I think they were so called because they were either a lake or a pool. I doubt not, then, but that it was a common name. Some say that the waters were then abundant, because there had been constant rains. But this conjecture is not probable. The simpler meaning is, that these waters were thus called, because in that part the abundance of water was not great in comparison with the lake. <span class="cite-ref">(125)</span> Ishmael then was found there. It is now added by the Prophet, that the captives rejoiced when they saw John, and immediately came over to his side. he therefore says, — </p><p><strong>(125)</strong> There was a pool in Gibeon, mentioned in <span class="bvs">2Sa_2:13</span>; and it must have been large, otherwise it would not have been called “great <em>waters.” </em>— <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
