<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你要对他们这样说，主耶和华如此说，我指着我的永生起誓，在荒场中的，必倒在刀下。在田野间的，必交给野兽吞吃。在保障和洞里的，必遭瘟疫而死。</div></div>
