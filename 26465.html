<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他说，他是个罪人不是，我不知道。有一件事我知道，从前我是眼瞎的，如今能看见了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>25.</strong><em>Whether he be a sinner, I know not. </em>The blind man appears not to have been at all prevented by fear from giving a sincere testimony. For there is no reason to believe that he had any doubts about Christ, as his words seem to imply; but I rather think that he spoke ironically, in order to wound them more deeply. He had already confessed that Christ was <em>a Prophet</em>, (verse 17.) Perceiving that he gains nothing by doing so, he suspends his judgment about the person, and brings forward the fact itself, so that, while he makes this admission in their favor, he is not free from ridiculing them. </p></div>
