<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">推罗的民，（民原文作女子），必来送礼。民中的富足人，也必向你求恩。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>12</strong><em>And the daughter of Tyre with a gift. </em>This also is a part of the recompense which the prophet promises to the queen in order to mitigate or rather to extinguish entirely, the longing desire she might still feel after her former condition. He says: that the Tyrians will come humbly to pay her reverence, bringing presents with them. Tyre, we know, was formerly a city of great renown, and, therefore, he accounts it a very high honor that men will come from a city so distinguished and opulent to greet her and to testify their submission to her. It is not necessary for us to examine every word minutely, in order to apply to the Church every thing here said concerning the wife of Solomon; but in our own day we realize some happy fruits of this prophecy when God has so ordered it, that some of the great men of this world, although they themselves refuse to submit to the authority of Christ, act with kindness towards the Church, maintaining and defending her. </p></div>
