<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这样，他们被自己所做的污秽了，在行为上犯了邪淫。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>39</strong><em>And they were polluted with their own works </em>He now concludes by stating generally, that the Jews, in adopting the abominable practices of the heathen, were become wholly filthy; because in all the devices of men there is nothing else than impurity. He denominates as the <em>works of men </em>all the false worship which they devise without the Divine sanction; as if he should say, that the holiness, which is truly connected with the worship of God, comes from his word, and that all human inventions and admixtures in religion are profane, and tend to corrupt the service of God. Doubtless it was the intention of the Israelites to serve God, but the Holy Spirit declares that all the fruit of their burning zeal was their becoming more abominable in God’s sight by their lewd inventions. For a strict adherence to the word of God constitutes spiritual chastity. </p></div>
