<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">将列国的神像都扔在火里，因为它本不是神，乃是人手所造的，是木头，石头的，所以灭绝它。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>For they are not gods, but the work of the hands of man, wood and stone. </em>By two arguments Hezekiah shews that “they were not gods;” first, because they consisted of matter, <span class="cite-ref">(55)</span> and secondly, because they were formed by the hands of men. Nothing can be more absurd than for a man to assume the right to create a god, not only because he had a beginning, while God is eternal, but because not even for a single moment does he subsist by his own power. Let the whole world collect all its strength into a single man, <span class="cite-ref">(56)</span> he will not even be able to create a fica. What presumption is it, therefore, that every mortal man shall make for himself either one god or many! <span class="cite-ref">(57)</span> Since, therefore, there is nothing in us but what is frail and fading, we shall never be able to produce a deity. </p><p>Besides, it is in the highest degree absurd to attempt, as an exercise of skill, to frame some deity out of matter which is corruptible and devoid of feeling, as if “wood or stone,” whenever it received a shape, began to be a god. In this manner, therefore, all the superstitions that men have ever invented are speedily overturned; for the existence of those gods can be found nowhere but in their own brains, and, indeed, all that they have of themselves contrived is condemned as empty and false. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(55)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’autant qu’ils estoyent de matire corruptible</span>.” “Because they were of corruptible matter.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(56)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">En un seul homme</span>.” </p><p><span class="cite-note">(57)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Quel orgueil estce donc que le premier qui voudra mettre la main a la besogne se face autant de dieux que bon luy semblera</span> !” “What presumption is it then that whoever shall first put his hand to the work shall make as many gods as he thinks proper!” </p></div></div>
