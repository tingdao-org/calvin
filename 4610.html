<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">七月初一日，你们当有圣会。什么劳碌的工都不可作，是你们当守为吹角的日子。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1</strong><em>And in the seventh month. </em>I have already observed that the festivals are not here (<em>generally</em>) treated of, but only the sacrifices, by which their solemnization was to be graced. In the beginning of the seventh month was the memorial, as it was called, of the blowing of trumpets. Because it was a minor festival, Moses only commands one bullock to be killed; but the number was increased on other grounds, for we have already seen that on the first of every month two bullocks were sacrificed. This day, therefore, had three larger victims, whilst the number of the others was doubled, so that there were two rams and fourteen lambs. Thus, then, God consecrated this day doubly to Himself, so that one celebration diminished nothing of the other; else He might have seemed to have abrogated what He had once commanded. The memorial of trumpets was not, then, an abolition of the new-moon, but they kept both ordinances at the same time. </p></div>
