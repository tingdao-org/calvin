<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">就吩咐拿他兵器的人说，你拔出刀来，将我刺死，免得那些未受割礼的人来刺我，凌辱我。但拿兵器的人甚惧怕，不肯刺他。扫罗就自己伏在刀上死了。</div></div>
