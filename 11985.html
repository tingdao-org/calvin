<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">自从先知撒母耳以来，在以色列中没有守过这样的逾越节，以色列诸王也没有守过，像约西亚，祭司，利未人，在那里的犹大人，和以色列人，以及耶路撒冷居民所守的逾越节。</div></div>
