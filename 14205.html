<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>Raise thyself, O Jehovah! </em>The psalm is at length concluded with a prayer, which again confirms that the kingdom which is spoken of is so connected with the glory of God, that his power is reflected from it. This was no doubt true with respect to the kingdom of David; for God in old time displayed his power in exalting him to the throne. But what is here stated was only fully accomplished in Christ, who was appointed by the heavenly Father to be King over us, and who is at the same time God manifest in the flesh. As his divine power ought justly to strike terror into the wicked, so it is described as full of the sweetest consolation to us, which ought to inspire us with joy, and incite us to celebrate it with songs of praise and thanksgivings. </p></div>
