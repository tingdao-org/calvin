<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Luk_24:41</span><strong>.</strong><em>But while they yet believed not for joy. </em>This passage shows also that they were not purposely incredulous, like persons who deliberately resolve not to believe; but while their will led them to believe eagerly, they were held bound by the vehemence of their feelings, so that they could not rest satisfied. For certainly the <em>joy </em>which Luke mentions arose from nothing but faith; and yet it hindered their faith from gaining the victory. Let us therefore observe with what suspicion we ought to regard the vehemence of our feelings, which, though it may have good beginnings, hurries us out of the right path. We are also reminded how earnestly we ought to struggle against every thing that retards faith, since the <em>joy </em>which sprung up in the minds of the apostles from the presence of Christ was the cause of their unbelief. </p></div>
