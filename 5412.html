<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">就如人与邻舍同入树林砍伐树木，手拿斧子一砍，本想砍下树木，不料，斧头脱了把，飞落在邻舍身上，以致于死，这人逃到那些城的一座城，就可以存活，</div></div>
