<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们偏离了真道，说复活的事已过，就败坏好些人的信心。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18</strong><em>Who, concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is already past </em>After having said that they had departed from “the truth,” he specifies their error, which consisted in this, that they gave out that “the resurrection was already past.” In doing this, they undoubtedly contrived a sort of allegorical resurrection, which has also been attempted in this age by some filthy dogs. By this trick Satan overthrows that fundamental article of our faith concerning the resurrection of the flesh. Being an old and worthless dream, and being so severely condemned by Paul, it ought to give us the less uneasiness. But when we learn that, from the very beginning of the gospel, <em>the faith of some was subverted, </em>such an example ought to excite us to diligence, that we may seize an early opportunity of driving away from ourselves and others so dangerous a plague; for, in consequence of the strong inclination of men to vanity, there is no absurdity so monstrous that there shall not be some men who shall lend their ear to it. </p></div>
