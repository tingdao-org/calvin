<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">应当向他唱新歌，弹得巧妙，声音洪亮。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Sing unto him a new song. </em>As the Psalmist afterwards treats of the mighty works of God, and particularly concerning the preservation of the Church, it is not wonderful that he exhorts the righteous to sing a new, that is, a rare and choice song. The more closely and diligently that believers consider the works of God, the more will they exert themselves in his praises. It is no common song, therefore, which he exhorts them to sing, but a song corresponding to the magnificence of the subject. This is also the meaning of the second clause, in which he urges them <em>to sing loudly. </em>In this sense, I understand the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">היתיב</span>, <em>heytib, </em>although others refer it rather to the proper setting of the notes. </p></div>
