<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">论到为圣徒捐钱，我从前怎样吩咐加拉太的众教会，你们也当怎样行。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>1.</strong><em>But concerning the collection </em>Luke relates (<span class="bvs">Act_11:28</span>) that the prediction of Agabus, foretelling that there would be a famine under Claudius Caesar, gave occasion for alms being collected by the saints, with the view of affording help to the brethren in Jerusalem. For though the Prophet had foretold, that this calamity would be generally prevalent almost throughout the world, yet as they were more heavily oppressed with penury at Jerusalem, and as all the Gentile Churches were bound, if they would not be held guilty of very great ingratitude, to afford aid to that place from which they had received the gospel, every one, consequently, forgetful of self, resolved to afford relief to Jerusalem. That the pressure of want was felt heavily at Jerusalem, appears from the Epistle to the Galatians, (<span class="bvs">Gal_2:10</span>,) where Paul relates, that he had been charged by the Apostles to stir up the Gentiles to afford help. <span class="cite-ref">(149)</span> Now the Apostles would never have given such a charge, had they not been constrained by necessity. Farther, this passage is an evidence of the truth of what Paul states there also — that he had been careful to exhort the Gentiles to afford help in such a case of necessity. Now, however, he prescribes the method of relief; and that the Corinthians may accede to it the more readily, he mentions that he had already prescribed it to the Churches of Galatia; for they would necessarily be the more influenced by example, as we are wont to feel a natural backwardness to anything that is not ordinarily practiced. Now follows the method — by which he designed to cut off all hinderances and impediments. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(149)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">D’inciter les Gentiles a subuenir a la pourete qui y estoit</span>;” — “To stir up the Gentiles to relieve the poverty that existed there.” </p></div></div>
