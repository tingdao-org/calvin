<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_8:4</span><strong>; </strong><span class="bvs">Mar_1:44</span><strong>.</strong><em>For a testimony to them </em>Some consider <em>testimony </em>to mean here a law or statute, as it is said in the Book of Psalms, God laid down this <em>“ </em>for a testimony to Israel,” (<span class="bvs">Psa_122:4</span>.) But this appears to me to be a poor exposition: for I have no doubt that the pronoun <em>to them </em>refers to the priests. <span class="cite-ref">(496)</span> Christ said this, in my opinion, with a view to the present occurrence: for this miracle was afterwards to be a sufficiently clear proof for convicting them of ingratitude. There is nothing inconsistent with this in the command which Christ gave to the leper to maintain silence: for he did not intend that the remembrance of the miracle which he had wrought should remain always buried. When the leper, at the command of Christ, came into the presence of the priest, this was <em>a testimony to them, </em>which would render them inexcusable, if they refused to receive Christ as the minister of God; and would, at the same time, take away occasion for slander, since Christ did not neglect a single point of the law. In a word, if they were not past cure, they might be led to Christ; while, on the other hand, so solemn a testimony of God was sufficiently powerful to condemn them, if they were unbelievers. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(496)</span> According to the view which Calvin rejects, the words, <em>which Moses commanded for a testimony to them, </em>mean, “which Moses delivered <em>to them, </em>that is, to the people of Israel, as a divine ordinance.” The view which he adopts may be more clearly brought out by a different arrangement of the words. <em>Present, for a testimony </em>to them, that is, “to the priests,” <em>the offering which Moses commanded</em>. —<em>Ed </em></p></div></div>
