<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因此，我的怒气和忿怒都倒出来，在犹大城邑中和耶路撒冷的街市上，如火着起，以致都荒废凄凉，正如今日一样。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now he adds, <em>On this account has my wrath and my fury been poured forth, and has burned through the cities of Judah, and through the streets of Jerusalem; and this day they are a waste and a desolation </em>The word <span class="lang he-il">שממה</span>, <em>shimme, </em>sometimes means amazement, as it has been before stated; but when it is connected with <span class="lang he-il">חרבה</span>, <em>cherebe, </em>as here, it means desolation. <em>As at this day; a </em>dreadful waste was then at that time apparent, he again refers to this truth, that the Jews ought to have been so touched by that remarkable and memorable instance of God’s displeasure, as not to abandon themselves afterwards to new idolatries; they ought to have remembered so recent an example of punishment. As, then, they still persevered in their hardness, it was an evidence of extreme impiety. The Prophet says that the perverseness of the Jews had not been unpunished, for God’s wrath had been poured forth against the cities of Judah, nay, against Jerusalem itself, the sanctuary of God, so that all things had been reduced to desolation. The Jews then ought, on the one hand, seriously to have considered how inexcusable had been their impiety in having so perversely despised God; and then they ought on the other hand, to have entertained fear and dread, since they saw that God had taken such vengeance on those who had despised his teaching and violated his worship. </p></div>
