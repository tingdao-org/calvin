<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因你为大，且行奇妙的事。惟独你是神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>For thou art great, and thou alone, O God! doest wondrous things. </em>In this verse there is again repeated the cause which will bring all nations to worship before the Lord, namely, the discovery made of his glory by the <em>greatness of his works. </em>The contemplation of God’s glory in his works is the true way of acquiring genuine godliness. The pride of the flesh would always lead it to wing its way into heaven; but, as our understandings fail us in such an extended investigation, our most profitable course is, according to the small measure of our feeble capacity, to seek God in his works, which bear witness of him. Let us therefore learn to awaken our understandings to contemplate the divine works, and let us leave the presumptuous to wander in their own intricate mazes, which, in the end, will invariably land them in an abyss from which they will be unable to extricate themselves. To incline our hearts to exercise this modesty, David magnificently extols the works of God, calling them <em>wondrous things, </em>although to the blind, and those who have no taste for them, they are destitute of attraction. In the meantime, we ought carefully to attend to this truth, That the glory of Godhead belongs exclusively to the one true God; for in no other being is it possible to find the wisdom, or the power, or the righteousness, or any of the numerous marks of divinity which shine forth in his wonderful works. Whence it follows, that the Papists are chargeable with rendering, as much as in them lies, his title to true Godhead nugatory, when despoiling him of his attributes they leave him almost nothing but the bare name. </p></div>
