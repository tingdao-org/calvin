<div class="CUV verse">门徒听见，就俯伏在地，极其害怕。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>And having heard this </em>God intended that the disciples should be struck with this terror, in order to impress more fully on their hearts the remembrance of the vision. Yet we see how great is the weakness of our nature, which trembles in this manner at hearing the voice of God. If ungodly men mock at God, or despise him without concern, it is because God does not address them so as to cause his presence to be felt; but the majesty of God, as soon as we perceive him, must unavoidably cast us down. </p></div>
