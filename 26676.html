<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>Show us the Father. </em>It appears to be very absurd that the Apostles should offer so many objections to the Lord; for why did he speak but to inform them on that point about which <em>Philip </em>puts the question? Yet there is not one of their faults that is here described that may not be charged on us as well as on them. We profess to be earnest in seeking God; and when he presents himself before our eyes, we are blind. </p></div>
