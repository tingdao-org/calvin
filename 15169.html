<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他在他们面前赶出外邦人，用绳子将外邦的地量给他们为业，叫以色列支派的人，住在他们的帐棚里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>55.</strong><em>He expelled the heathen from before them; and made them to fall into their part of the inheritance. </em>These words are an explanation of the concluding sentence of the preceding verse: they describe the manner in which the land of Canaan was acquired, plainly intimating that the Israelites were not such a warlike race, nor those heathen nations so cowardly, as to render it an easy matter for the former to vanquish the latter, and that it would have been impossible for the former to have expelled the latter from the country, had they not been led on to victory under the conduct of God, and been aided by his power. Besides, it would have been unlawful for them to have taken possession of the country, had it not been the will of God that the first inhabitants should be deprived of it, and that strangers should be established in it in their room. </p></div>
