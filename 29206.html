<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>The grace </em><span class="cite-ref">(105)</span><em>of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit</em>. His prayer is not only that God may bestow upon them his grace in large measure, but that they may have a proper feeling of it in their hearts. Then only is it truly enjoyed by us, when it comes to our <em>spirit</em>. We ought therefore to entreat that God would prepare in our souls a habitation for his grace. Amen. </p><p>END OF THE COMMENTARIES ON THE<LineBreak />EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS. </p><p><strong>(105)</strong> “It is of little moment whether, by the ‘grace,’ we understand that free love and favour, which He always bears in his heart to all that believe in his name, or all that kindness — all those heavenly and spiritual blessings — in the communication of which He manifests this love, this free favour.” — Brown. </p></div>
