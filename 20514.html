<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你往你本国被掳的子民那里去，他们或听，或不听，你要对他们讲说，告诉他们这是主耶和华说的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now it is added, <em>that he may go and proceed to the captivity, to the children of his own people </em>We see, then, that God does not regard the Prophet so much as the Israelites, because they had never willingly yielded to the Prophet when he brought a message by no means pleasing. For nothing could be more sad and hateful to them than to hear threats and curses. Because, then, they had never willingly bent to obedience, he is sent with a testimony that he had learnt what he uttered in God’s school; then that he had so learnt from God, that he adds nothing of his own; lastly, that he so speaks, that; the obstinacy of the people is not <em>overcome: Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, do thou nevertheless go forward </em>Wherefore? <em>Thou shalt say, thus saith the Lord. </em>We have already explained the meaning of this phrase, namely, where we are persuaded that our labor is pleasing to God, although it be useless to men, yet this ought to suffice us, that God has sent us. Then he wishes to try our constancy, lest when we see ourselves laboring in vain, we should cease on that account, instead of being prepared to obey, whatever may happen. </p></div>
