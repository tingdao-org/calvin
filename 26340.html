<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>The Jews therefore sought him. </em>Here we ought to consider what was the condition of the Church. For the Jews, at that time, gaped for the promised redemption like hungry men; yet, when Christ appears to them, they remain in suspense. Hence arose that murmuring and that variety of opinions. That they whisper secretly is an indication of the tyranny which the priests and scribes exercised over them. It is a shocking exhibition, indeed, that this Church, which was at that time the only Church on earth, is here represented to us as a confused and shapeless chaos. <span class="cite-ref">(184)</span> They who rule, instead of pastors, hold the people oppressed by fear and terror, and throughout the whole body there is shameful desolation and lamentable disorder. By <em>the Jews </em>he means the common people, who, having been accustomed for two years to hear Christ, inquire about him, because he does not appear according to his custom. For when they say, <em>Where is he? </em>they describe a man whom they knew, and yet that word shows that they had not yet been earnestly moved, and that they always remained in doubt and suspense. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(184)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Comme un abysme de confusion et disordre</span>;” — “as a gulf of confusion and disorder.” </p></div></div>
