<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为约瑟的子孙是两个支派，就是玛拿西和以法莲，所以没有把地分给利未人，但给他们城邑居住，并城邑的郊野，可以牧养他们的牲畜，安置他们的财物。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>They gave no part unto the Levites, </em>etc It is here repeated for the third time with regard to the Levites, that they were not included in the number, so as to have the portion of a tribe assigned to them; but it is mentioned for a different purpose, for it is immediately after added, that the sons of Joseph were divided into two tribes, and were thus privileged to obtain a double portion. Thus had Jacob prophesied, (<span class="bvs">Gen_49:0</span>) or rather, like an arbiter appointed by God, he had in this matter preferred the sons of Joseph to the others. God therefore assumed the Levites to himself as a peculiar inheritance, and in their stead substituted one of the two families of Joseph. </p></div>
