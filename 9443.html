<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">便哈达对王说，我父从你父那里所夺的城邑，我必归还。你可以在大马色立街市，像我父在撒玛利亚所立的一样。亚哈说，我照此立约，放你回去，就与他立约，放他去了。</div></div>
