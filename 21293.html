<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人子阿，你要对本国的人民说，义人的义，在犯罪之日不能救他。至于恶人的恶，在他转离恶行之日也不能使他倾倒。义人在犯罪之日也不能因他的义存活。</div></div>
