<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大卫的长兄以利押听见大卫与他们所说的话，就向他发怒，说，你下来作什么呢？在旷野的那几只羊，你交托了谁呢？我知道你的骄傲和你心里的恶意，你下来特为要看争战。</div></div>
