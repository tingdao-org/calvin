<div class="CUV verse">你从有野食之山而来，有光华和荣美。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>It is farther added, (verse 4<span class="cite-ref">th</span>,) that <em>God is more glorious and terrible than the mountains of prey </em>By <em>the mountains of prey, </em>is meant kingdoms distinguished for their violence and extortion. We know that from the beginning, he who exercised himself most in robbery and pillage, was the man who most enlarged his borders and became greatest. The Psalmist, therefore, here compares those great kings, who had acquired large dominions by violence and the shedding of human blood, to savage beasts, who live only upon prey, and their kingdoms to mountains covered with forests, which are inhabited by beasts inured to live by the destruction of other animals. The enemies of God’s ancient people had been accustomed to make violent and furious assaults upon Jerusalem; but it is affirmed that God greatly surpassed them all in power that the faithful might not be overwhelmed with terror. </p></div>
