<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华说，日子将到，我必打发倒酒的往她那里去，将她倒出来，倒空她的器皿，打碎她的坛子。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet said in the last lecture that the Moabites, as long as they lived prosperously, were very hardened, as impunity becomes an incentive to sin; for the ungodly, while God spares them, think that they shall never be called to an account. He now adds, that the <em>days </em>would <em>come</em>, in which God would suddenly execute vengeance on them. But he pursues the comparison which he had used; for he had said, that the Moabites were like wine which had not been poured from one vessel into another; and hence they retained their own odor, that is, they were inebriated with their own pleasures, because God had granted them peace and quietness for a long time. </p><p>Now, the Prophet, on the other hand, says that God would send to them <em>drivers</em>, <span class="cite-ref">(7)</span><em>to drive them away</em>, and who would <em>empty their vessels and scatter their bottles, </em>— the containing for the contained; though I do not disapprove of another rendering, “and destroy their bottles;” for the verb is sometimes taken in this sense. Properly it means to scatter, to dissipate; but the verb <span class="lang he-il">נפף</span>, <em>nuphets</em>, sometimes expresses a stronger idea, even to scatter or to cast forth with violence, so as to break what is thus cast forth. As to the real meaning there is not much difference: for we perceive what was God’s purpose, that he would send to the Moabites enemies to drive them into exile, and thus to deprive them of those pleasures in which they had so long indulged. But this was not said for the sake of the Moabites, but that the Jews might know, that though that land had been in a quiet state, yet it would not escape the hand of God; for its long continued felicity could not render void that decree of God of which the Prophet had spoken. It now follows — </p><p><strong>(7)</strong> “Incliners” is the <em>Sept.; </em>“strewers,” the <em>Vulg</em>. ; “plunderers,” the <em>Syr. </em>and <em>Targ. </em>The verb means to spread, to strew. They were those who turned the wine vessels in order to empty them. <em>Henderson </em>has “overturners;” but <em>Blayney </em>has the best word, “tilters,” who should tilt him. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
