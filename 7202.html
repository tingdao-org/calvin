<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在城门坐着的众民和长老都说，我们作见证。愿耶和华使进你家的这女子，像建立以色列家的拉结，利亚二人一样。又愿你在以法他得亨通，在伯利恒得名声。</div></div>
