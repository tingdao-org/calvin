<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">现在我解开你手上的链子，你若看与我同往巴比伦去好，就可以去，我必厚待你。你若看与我同往巴比伦去不好，就不必去。看哪，全地在你面前，你以为哪里美好，哪里合宜，只管上哪里去吧。</div></div>
