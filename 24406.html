<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>41.</strong><em>And he took hold of her hand, and said to her </em><span class="bvs">Luk_8:54</span><strong>.</strong><em>And he took hold of her hand, and cried </em>Though naturally this <em>cry </em>was of no avail for recalling the senses of the deceased young woman, yet Christ intended to give a magnificent display of the power of his voice, that he might more fully accustom men to listen to his doctrine. It is easy to learn from this the great efficacy of the voice of Christ, which reaches even to the dead, and exerts a quickening influence on death itself. Accordingly, Luke says that <em>her spirit returned, </em>or, in other words, that immediately on being called, it obeyed the command of Christ. </p></div>
