<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们若说是与神相交，却仍在黑暗里行，就是说谎话，不行真理了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6</strong><em>If we say </em>It is, indeed, an argument from what is inconsistent, when he concludes that they are alienated from God, who walk in darkness. This doctrine, however, depends on a higher principle, that God sanctifies all who are his. For it is not a naked precept that he gives, which requires that our life should be holy; but he rather shews that the grace of Christ serves for this end to dissipate darkness, and to kindle in us the light of God; as though he had said, “What God communicates to us is not a vain fiction; for it is necessary that the power and effect of this fellowship should shine forth in our life; otherwise the possession of the gospel is fallacious.” What he adds, <em>and do not the truth</em>, is the same as if he had said, “We do not act truthfully. We do not regard what is true and right.” And this mode of speaking, as I have before observed, is frequently used by him. </p></div>
