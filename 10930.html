<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">将城里的人拉出来，放在锯下，或铁耙下，或铁斧下（或作强他们用锯，或用打粮食的铁器，或用铁斧作工），大卫待亚扪各城的居民都是如此。其后大卫和众军都回耶路撒冷去了。</div></div>
