<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">从肥美的田中，夺去了欢喜快乐。在葡萄园里，必无歌唱，也无欢呼的声音。踹酒的在酒榨中不得踹出酒来。我使他欢呼的声音止息。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Joy is taken away. </em>He confirms, by different words, what he has now said, that the whole country shall be desolate and forsaken, so that there shall never again be in it a harvest or a vintage. When he threatens that God will cause the vine-dressers to cease to sing, he refers to an ancient custom; for when they gathered the vintage, they usually testified their joy both by dancing and by singing. Hence these words of Virgil, <em>The exhausted vine-dresser now addresses by song his farthest rows </em><span class="cite-ref">(268)</span> In like manner, the sailors, when they approach the harbour, raise their shout of joy, (<span class="lang el-gr">κἐλευσμα</span>,) because, having finished their toils, and escaped dangers, they see that they have hope of obtaining some leisure or refreshment. It is as if the Prophet had said, “When the produce of the harvest shall be taken away, nothing will be left to them but to lament their poverty.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(268)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
