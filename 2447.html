<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们快快偏离了我所吩咐的道，为自己铸了一只牛犊，向它下拜献祭，说，以色列阿，这就是领你出埃及地的神。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>They have turned aside quickly out of the way</em>. So speedy a transgression, as I have said, aggravates their crime. God then states the nature of their corruption, that they have worshipped a molten calf, that is to say, the work of their own hands. But it is to be observed, that what they had put forward as a colouring for their ungodliness is alleged last, as the climax of their sin; for, when they said that these were their gods which had brought them up, their object was to advance a legitimate excuse, as if they were not falling away from the worship of the true God, and their Deliverer, but that rather it was an evidence of their more fervent zeal, that they should fall down as worshippers before the calf in honor of Him. But God retorts this upon them, and complains of the gross indignity which was put upon Him, when the dead image of a calf was substituted in the place of His glory. </p></div>
