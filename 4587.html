<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当安息日，要献两只没有残疾，一岁的公羊羔，并用调油的细面伊法十分之二为素祭，又将同献的奠祭献上。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>And on the Sabbath-day. </em>What was omitted in the former passage is here supplied, i.e., that on the Sabbath the continual sacrifice was to be doubled, and two lambs offered instead of one; for it was reasonable that, as the seventh day was peculiarly dedicated to God, it should be exalted above other days by some extraordinary and distinctive mark. He also commands greater sacrifices to be offered at the beginning of the month or new moon, viz., two bullocks and one ram, and a goat for a sin-offering; for we know that the first day of every month was consecrated to God, that the people might more frequently have the remembrance of their religious duties renewed; and the goat for an atonement for sin was added, in order that every month they should present themselves as guilty before God to deprecate His wrath. </p></div>
