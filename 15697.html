<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">为他们记念他的约，照他丰盛的慈爱后悔。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>And he remembered </em>God’s being mindful of his covenant is here assigned as the cause of his great mercy and long-suffering. In that covenant, he not only declares that there is a gracious pardon for transgressions, but he also adverts to the perverse blindness of those who were not brought back by such remedies to the covenant, in which they were well aware that their safety was placed. But above all, he charges them with ingratitude; because, when deserving to perish, they did not acknowledge that they were indebted to the mercy of God alone for their preservation. This observation is strengthened by the next clause of the verse, in which he says that God had spared them <em>according to the greatness of his mercies </em>For the greatness of the punishment which their sins deserved, may be inferred from the great treasures of his loving-kindness, which God had to open in order to procure their redemption. The word to <em>repent </em>expresses no change in God, but only in the mode of administering his corrections. It may seem as if God altered his purpose, when he mitigates punishment, or withdraws his hand from executing his judgments. The Scripture, however, accommodating itself to our weak and limited capacity, speaks only after the manner of men. </p></div>
