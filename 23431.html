<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那家若配得平安，你们所求的平安，就必临到那家。若不配得，你们所求的平安仍归你们。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>13.</strong><em>If it be not worthy. </em>The import of this mode of expression may be thus stated, — “As their ingratitude makes them unworthy to enjoy the blessing of God which you have supplicated for them, break off every bond of communication.” The <em>word peace </em>refers to the mode of salutation which generally used among the Jews. As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">שלום</span>, <em>(shalom,) peace, </em>denotes <em>prosperity, </em>when they desire that any one may be well and happy, and that his affairs may succeed to his wish, they pray that he may have <em>peace </em>I do acknowledge that the apostles brought to men a different kind of peace, but it is too great a refinement of speculation to make this passage refer to the free reconciliation which takes place between God and men. </p></div>
