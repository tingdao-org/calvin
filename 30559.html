<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">人若说自己在光明中。却恨他的弟兄，他到如今还是在黑暗里。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9</strong><em>He that saith he is in the light </em>He pursues the same metaphor. He said that love is the only true rule according to which our life is to be formed; he said that this rule or law is presented to us in the Gospel; he said, lastly, that it is there as the meridian light, which ought to be continually looked on. Now, on the other hand, he concludes that all are blind and walk in darkness who are strangers to love. But that he mentioned before the love of God and now the love of the brethren, involves no more contrariety than there is between the effect and its cause. Besides, these are so connected together that they cannot be separated. </p></div>
