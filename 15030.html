<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们的口亵渎上天，他们的舌毁谤全地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>They have set their mouth against the heavens. </em>Here it is declared that they utter their contumelious speeches as well against God as against men; for they imagine that nothing is too arduous for them to attempt, and flatter themselves that heaven and earth are subject to them. If any should endeavor to alarm them by setting before them the power of God, they audaciously break through this barrier; and, with respect to men, they have no idea of any difficulty arising from such a quarter. Thus, there is no obstacle to repress their proud and vaunting speeches, but <em>their tongue walketh through the whole earth. </em>This form of expression seems to be hyperbolical; but when we consider how great and unbounded their presumption is, we will admit that the Psalmist teaches nothing but what experience shows to be matter of fact. </p></div>
