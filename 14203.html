<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为他们有意加害于你。他们想出计谋，却不能作成。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>For they have spread out. </em>In this verse David shows that the ungodly had deserved the awful ruin which he predicted would befall them, since they had not only molested mortal man, but had also rushed forth in the fury of their pride to make war against God himself. No man, as has been stated in our exposition of the second psalm, could offer violence to the kingdom of Israel, which was consecrated in the person of David, by the commandment of God, without making foul and impious war against God. Much more when persons directly attack the kingdom of Christ to overthrow it, is the majesty of God violated, since it is the will of God to reign in the world only by the hand of his Son. As the Hebrew word <span class="lang he-il">נטה</span>, <em>natah, </em>which we have translated <em>to spread out, </em>also sometimes signifies <em>to turn aside, </em>it may not unsuitably be here rendered either way. According to the first view the meaning is, that the wicked, as if they had spread out their nets, endeavored to subject to themselves the power of God. According to the second the meaning is, that for the purpose of hindering, and as it were swallowing up his power, <span class="cite-ref">(491)</span> they turned aside their malice, so as to make it bear against it, just like a man who, having dug a great ditch, turned aside the course of some torrent to make it fall within it. The Psalmist next declares, that they <em>devised a stratagem, </em>or device, which would fail of its accomplishment. By these words he rebukes the foolish arrogance of those who, by making war against God, manifest a recklessness and an audacity which will undertake any thing, however daring. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(491)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Pour icello empescher et comme engloutir</span>.” — <em>Fr</em>. </p></div></div>
