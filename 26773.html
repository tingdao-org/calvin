<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>I have given them thy word. </em>He employs a different argument in pleading with the Father on behalf of the disciples. It is, because they need his assistance on account of <em>the hatred of the world. </em>He likewise declares the cause of that <em>hatred </em>to be, that they have embraced <em>the word </em>of God, which the world cannot receive; as if he had said, “It belongs to thee to protect those who, on account of <em>thy word, </em>are <em>hated by the world.” </em>We must now keep in remembrance what we have lately heard, that the end of this prayer is, <em>that Christ’s joy may be fulflled in us </em>As often, therefore, as the rage of the world is kindled against us to such an extent that we think we are very near destruction, let us learn suddenly to ward it off by this shield, that God will never forsake those who labor in defense of the Gospel. </p><p><em>Because they are not of the world. </em>He says that his disciples <em>are not of the world, </em>because all those whom he regenerates by his Spirit are separated <em>from the world </em>God will not suffer his sheep to wander among wolves, without showing himself to be their shepherd. </p></div>
