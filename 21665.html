<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">在各节期，国内居民朝见耶和华的时候，从北门进入敬拜的，必由南门而出。从南门进入的，必由北门而出。不可从所入的门而出，必要直往前行，由对门而出。</div></div>
