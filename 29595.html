<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">为此，我既不能再忍，就打发人去，要晓得你们的信心如何，恐怕那诱惑人的到底诱惑了你们，叫我们的劳苦归于徒然。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5</strong><em>Lest perhaps the tempter has tempted you</em>. By this term he teaches us that temptations are always to be dreaded, because it is the proper office of Satan to <em>tempt</em>. As, however, he never ceases to place ambushes for us on all sides, and to lay snares for us all around, so we must be on our watch, eagerly taking heed. And now he says openly what in the outset he had avoided saying, as being too harsh — that he had felt concerned lest his <em>labors </em>should be <em>vain</em>, if, peradventure, Satan should prevail. And this he does that they may be carefully upon their watch, and may stir themselves up the more vigorously to resistance. </p></div>
