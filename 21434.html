<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">过了多日，你必被差派。到末后之年，你必来到脱离刀剑从列国收回之地，到以色列常久荒凉的山上。但那从列国中招聚出来的必在其上安然居住。</div></div>
