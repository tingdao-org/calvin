<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">拉结说，有我的使女辟拉在这里，你可以与她同房，使她生子在我膝下，我便因她也得孩子（得孩子原文作被建立）。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Behold my maid Bilhah</em>. Here the vanity of the female disposition appears. For Rachel is not induced to flee unto the Lord, but strives to gain a triumph by illicit arts. Therefore she hurries Jacob into a third marriage. Whence we infer, that there is no end of sinning, when once the Divine institution is treated with neglect. And this is what I have said, that Jacob was not immediately brought back to a right state of mind by Divine chastisements. He acts, indeed, in this instance, at the instigation of his wife: but is his wife in the place of God, from whom alone the law of marriage proceeds? But to please his wife, or to yield to her importunity, he does not scruple to depart from the command of God. <em>To bear upon the knees</em>, is nothing more than to commit the child when born to another to be brought up. Bilhah was a maidservant; and therefore did not bear for herself but for her mistress, who, claiming the child as her own, thus procured the honor of a mother. Therefore it is added, in the way of explanation, <em>I shall have children, </em>or <em>I shall be built up by her. </em>For the word which Moses here uses, is derived from <span class="lang he-il">בן</span> (<em>ben</em>,) <em>a son</em>: because children are as the support and stay of a house. But Rachel acted sinfully, because she attempted, by an unlawful method, and in opposition to the will of God, to become a mother. </p></div>
