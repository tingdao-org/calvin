<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>It shall be as a bird let loose. </em><span class="cite-ref">(251)</span> The Prophet now shows what he meant by the former mockery, that the Moabites ought not at that time to think of <em>sending </em>sacrifices, because they will not be able to provide for their safety in any other way than by leaving their native country. By the metaphor of <em>birds </em>he describes the terror with which they shall be struck, so that they will flee even at the rustling of a leaf. He threatens that the Moabites, who had abused their tranquillity, shall have a trembling and wearisome flight. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(251)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
