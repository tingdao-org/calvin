<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Thine oxen also. </em>When he promises that the oxen and the asses shall eat abundant and clean provender, this is a repetition and confirmation of what was stated in the preceding verse. This passage is taken from the Law, (<span class="bvs">Deu_28:11</span>,) and is gladly and frequently quoted by the prophets, in order that we may learn to discern in the sickness and death of cattle the indignation of God, and to desire more earnestly to be reconciled to him, that our houses may be filled with his goodness. </p></div>
