<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">求你将我放在你心上如印记，带在你臂上如戳记。因为爱情如死之坚强。嫉恨如阴间之残忍。所发的电光，是火焰的电光，是耶和华的烈焰。</div></div>
