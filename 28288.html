<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们若活着，是为主而活。若死了，是为主而死。所以我们或活或死，总是主的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>8.</strong><em>To the Lord we live, etc. </em>This does not mean the same as when it is said in <span class="bvs">Rom_6:11</span>, that we are made <em>alive unto God </em>by his Spirit, but that we conform to his will and pleasure, and design all things to his glory. Nor are we only to live to the Lord, but also to die; that is, our death as well as our life is to be referred to his will. He adds the best of reasons, for <em>whether we live or die, we are his: </em>and it hence follows, that he has full authority over our life and our death. </p><p>The application of this doctrine opens into a wide field. God thus claims authority over life and death, that his own condition might be borne by every one as a yoke laid on him; for it is but just that he should assign to every one his station and his course of life. And thus we are not only forbidden rashly to attempt this or that without God’s command, but we are also commanded to be patient under all troubles and losses. If at any time the flesh draws back in adversities, let it come to our minds, that he who is not free nor has authority over himself, perverts right and order if he depends not on the will of his lord. Thus also is taught us the rule by which we are to live and to die, so that if he extends our life in continual sorrows and miseries, we are not yet to seek to depart before our time; but if he should suddenly call us hence in the flower of our age, we ought ever to be ready for our departure. </p></div>
