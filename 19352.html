<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">却要指着那领以色列人从北方之地，并赶他们到的各国上来之永生的耶和华起誓，并且我要领他们再入我从前赐给他们列祖之地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><em>But, </em>it will be rather said, <em>Live does Jehovah, for he has brought his people from the land of the north; </em>and for this reason, because there will be less hope remaining for you, when the Chaldeans shall subdue and scatter you like a body torn asunder, and when the name of Israel shall be extinguished, when the worship of God shall be subverted and the Temple destroyed. When therefore all things shall appear to be past remedy, this captivity shall be much more dreadful than that by which your fathers had been oppressed. Therefore, when God restores you, it will be a miracle much more remarkable. And that the Prophet took occasion to give thom some hope of God’s favor, may be gathered from the end of the verse, when he says, <em>And I will make them to return to their own land: </em>but the copulative ought to be rendered as a conditional particle, as though he had said, <em>When I shall restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers </em>It now follows — </p></div>
