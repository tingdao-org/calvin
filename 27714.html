<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>What shall I do, Lord? </em>This is the voice of a tamed man, and this is the true turning unto the Lord; when laying away all fierceness and fury, we bow down our necks willingly to bear his yoke, and are ready to do whatsoever he commandeth us. Moreover, this is the beginning of well-doing, to ask the mouth of God; for their labor is lost who think upon repentance without his word. Furthermore, in that Christ appointeth Ananias to be Paul’s master, he doth it not for any reproach, or because he refuseth to teach him; but by this means he meaneth to set forth, and also to beautify the outward ministry of the Church.</p><p>And even in the person of one man, he teacheth us<span class="cite-ref">(503)</span> that we must not grudge to hear him speak with the tongue of men. To the same end tendeth that which followeth immediately, that he was blind, until offering himself to become a scholar, he had declared<span class="cite-ref">(504)</span> the humility of his faith. God doth not indeed make blind all those whom he will lighten; but there is a general rule prescribed to all men, that those become foolish with themselves who will be wise to him. </p><p><strong>(503)</strong></p><p>“ Commune documentum nobis praebuit,” he hath given us a common proof, </p><p><strong>(504)</strong></p><p>“ Probasset,” he had proved. </p></div>
