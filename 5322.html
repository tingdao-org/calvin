<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">豁免的定例乃是这样，凡债主要把所借给邻舍的豁免了。不可向邻舍和弟兄追讨，因为耶和华的豁免年已经宣告了。</div></div>
