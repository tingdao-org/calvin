<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">就怨？？神和摩西说，你们为什么把我们从埃及领出来，使我们死在旷野呢？这里没有粮，没有水，我们的心厌恶这淡薄的食物。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>5.</strong><em>And the people spake against God and against Moses. </em>Either because they murmured against God in the person of Moses, or else because their impiety broke forth to such a furious extent, that they openly blasphemed against God; and this latter opinion is most in accordance with the words, because by their use of the plural number they accuse two parties together. <span class="cite-ref">(120)</span> But, inasmuch as Moses had nothing separate from God, no one could enter into a contest with him without warring also against God Himself. Here, however, as I have said, their insolence proceeded still further, so as not only to rail against the minister, but to vomit forth also their wicked blasphemy against God Himself, as if He had injured them most grossly by their deliverance. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(120)</span> Addition in <em>Fr., </em>“sinon qu’ils s’addressent aussi a Aaron;” unless they also address Aaron. </p></div></div>
