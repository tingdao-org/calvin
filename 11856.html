<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">这事既都完毕，在那里的以色列众人就到犹大的城邑，打碎柱像，砍断木偶，又在犹大，便雅悯，以法莲，玛拿西遍地将丘坛和祭坛拆毁净尽。于是以色列众人各回各城，各归各地。</div></div>
