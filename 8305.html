<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">到第七日，孩子死了。大卫的臣仆不敢告诉他孩子死了，因他们说，孩子还活着的时候，我们劝他，他尚且不肯听我们的话，若告诉他孩子死了，岂不更加忧伤吗？</div></div>
