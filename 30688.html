<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">要在众人身上行审判，证实那一切不敬虔的人，所妄行一切不敬虔的事，又证实不敬虔之罪人所说顶撞他的刚愎话。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>But the vengeance suspended over the wicked ought to keep the elect in fear and watchfulness. He speaks of <em>deeds </em>and <em>words</em>, Because their corrupters did much evil, not only by their wicked life, but also by their impure and false speech. And their words were <em>hard</em>, on account of the refractory audacity, by which, being elated, they acted insolently. <span class="cite-ref">(199)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(199)</span> There seems to be a want of due order in the 15<span class="cite-ref">th</span> verse; the execution of judgment is mentioned first, and then the conviction of the ungodly; but it is an order which exactly corresponds with numberless passages in Scripture: the final action first, and then that which lends to it. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
