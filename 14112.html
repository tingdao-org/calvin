<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">求你保护我，如同保护眼中的瞳人。将我隐藏在你翅膀的荫下，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The two similitudes which David has subjoined in the following verse, respecting <em>the apple of the eye, </em>and the little birds which the mother keeps <em>under her wings, </em><span class="cite-ref">(363)</span> are introduced for illustrating the same subject. God, to express the great care which he has of his own people, compares himself to a hen and other fowls, which spread out their wings to cherish and cover their young, and declares them to be no less dear to him than the apple of the eye, which is the tenderest part of the body, is to man; it follows, therefore, that whenever men rise up to molest and injure the righteous, war is waged against him. As this form of prayer was put into the mouth of David by the Holy Spirit, it is to be regarded as containing in it a promise. We have here presented to our contemplation a singular and an astonishing proof of the goodness of God, in humbling himself so far, and in a manner so to speak, transforming himself, in order to lift up our faith above the conceptions of the flesh. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(363)</span> “<span class="lang fr-fr">Et des petis oiseaux que la mere tient sous ses ailes</span>.” —<em>Fr. </em></p></div></div>
