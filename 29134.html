<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">我们为孩童的时候，受管于世俗小学之下，也是如此。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>Under the elements of the world. Elements </em>may either mean, literally, outward and bodily things, or, metaphorically, rudiments. I prefer the latter interpretation. But why does he say that those things which had a spiritual signification were <em>of the world </em>? We did not, he says, enjoy the truth in a simple form, but involved in earthly figures; and consequently, what was outward must have been “of the world,” though there was concealed under it a heavenly mystery. </p></div>
