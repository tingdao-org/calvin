<div class="CUV verse">二人经过彼西底，来到旁非利亚。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>24.</strong><em>Passing through Pisidia. </em>We have already said that Paul and Barnabas came to Antioch of Pisidia. Being now about to return to Antioch of Syria, whence they were sent away, they go through Pamphylia, which is the middle region toward the mount Taurus. And Perga and Attalia are cities lying near together. And whereas Luke saith, that they preach the Word in the one only, we may thereby guess that they had not opportunity offered them everywhere to teach, which they were wont to neglect or let pass nowhere.</p></div>
