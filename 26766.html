<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">如今他们知道，凡你所赐给我的，都是从你那里来的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>7.</strong><em>Now they have known. </em>Here our Lord expresses what is the chief part in faith, which consists in our believing in Christ in such a manner, that faith does not rest satisfied with beholding the flesh, but perceives his Divine power. For when he says, They have known that all things which thou hast given me are from thee, he means, that believers feel that all that they possess is heavenly and divine. And, indeed, if we do not perceive God in Christ, we must remain continually in a state of hesitation. </p></div>
