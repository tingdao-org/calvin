<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">求你侧耳而听，快快救我，作我坚固的磐石，拯救我的保障。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>2.</strong><em>incline thine ear unto me. </em>These words express with how much ardor David’s soul was stimulated to pray. He affects no splendid or ornate language, as rhetoricians are wont to do; but only describes in suitable figures the vehemence of his desire. In praying that he may be delivered <em>speedily </em>there is shown the greatness of his danger, as if he had said, All will soon be over with my life, unless God make haste to help me. By the words, <em>house of defense, fortress, </em>and <em>rock, </em>he intimates, that, being unable to resist his enemies, his hope rests only on the protection of God. </p></div>
