<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">法老的马匹，车辆，和马兵下到海中，耶和华使海水回流，淹没他们，惟有以色列人在海中走干地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>19.</strong><em>For the horse of Pharaoh went in. </em>This verse does not; seem to be suited to the song, and therefore I am rather of opinion that Moses returns here to the history, and assigns the reason why the Israelites so magnificently celebrated the praises of God. For the sake of avoiding ambiguity, it would perhaps be better thus to render it, — “For the horse of Pharaoh had gone in, and the Lord had brought again the waters of the sea upon them, but; the children of Israel had gone on dry land.” <span class="cite-ref">(168)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(168)</span> There is the following addition in the <em>Fr</em>. : — ‘Voyla pourquoy j’ai mis les verbes en temps plus que parfait;” you see why I have put the words in the pluperfect tense. </p></div></div>
