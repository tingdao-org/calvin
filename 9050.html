<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当日，王因耶和华殿前的铜坛太小，容不下燔祭，素祭，和平安祭牲的脂油，便将耶和华殿前院子当中分别为圣，在那里献燔祭，素祭，和平安祭牲的脂油。</div></div>
