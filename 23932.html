<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in."</div>

<div class="comment-content"><p><span class="bvs">Mat_23:13</span><strong>.</strong><em>You shut up the kingdom of heaven. </em>Christ pronounces a curse on them, because they pervert their office to the general destruction of the whole people; for since the government of the Church was in their hands, they ought to have been, as it were, <em>porters </em>for <em>the kingdom of heaven. </em>What purpose is served by religion and holy doctrine but to open heaven to us? For we know that all mankind are banished from God, and excluded from the inheritance of eternal salvation. Now the doctrine of religion may be said to be the door by which we enter into life, and therefore Scripture says metaphorically, that the keys of the kingdom of heaven are given to pastors, as I have explained more fully under <span class="bvs">Mat_16:19</span>. And we ought to abide by this definition, which appears still more strongly from the words of Luke, in which Christ reproaches the <em>lawyers </em>with <em>having taken away the key of knowledge, </em>which means that, though they were the guardians of the Law of God, they deprived the people of the true understanding of it. As, therefore, in the present day, <em>the keys of the kingdom of heaven </em>are committed to the custody of pastors, that they may admit believers into eternal life, and exclude unbelievers from all expectation of it, so the priests and scribes anciently under the Law held the same office. </p><p>From the word <em>knowledge </em>we infer how absurdly the Papists forge false <em>keys, </em>as if they possessed some magical power apart from the word of God; for Christ declares that none but those who are ministers of doctrine have the use of <em>keys. </em>If it be objected, that the Pharisees, though they were perverse expounders of the Law still held <em>the keys, </em>I reply: Though, in respect of their office, <em>the keys </em>were entrusted to them, yet they were suppressed by malice and deceit, so that they no longer retained the use of them. And therefore Christ says, that they <em>took away, </em>or <em>stole </em>that <em>key of knowledge, </em>by which they ought to have opened the gate of <em>heaven. </em>In like manner, <em>heaven </em>is <em>shut </em>by Popery against the wretched people, while the very pastors—or, at least, those who hold that office—prevent them by their tyranny from being opened. If we are not excessively indifferent, we will not willingly enter into a league with wicked tyrants, who cruelly <em>shut </em>against us the entrance into life. </p></div>
