<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">凡恨他弟兄的，就是杀人的。你们晓得凡杀人的，没有永生存在他里面。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15</strong><em>Is a murderer </em>To stimulate us still more to love, he shews how detestable before God is hatred. There is no one who dreads not a murderer; nay, we all execrate the very name. But the Apostle declares that all who hate their brethren are murderers. He could have said nothing more atrocious; nor is what is said hyperbolical, for we wish him to perish whom we hate. It does not matter if a man keeps his hands from mischief; for the very desire to do harm, as well as the attempt, is condemned before God: nay, when we do not ourselves seek to do an injury, yet if we wish an evil to happen to our brother from some one else, we are murderers. </p><p>Then the Apostle defines the thing simply as it is, when he ascribes murder to hatred. Hence is proved the folly of men, that though they abominate the name, they yet make no account of the crime itself. Whence is this? even because the external face of things engrosses our thoughts; but the inward feeling comes to an account before God. Let no one therefore extenuate any more so grievous an evil. Let us learn to refer our judgments to the tribunal of God. </p></div>
