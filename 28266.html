<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你不可为恶所胜，反要以善胜恶。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>Be not overcome by evil, etc. </em>This sentence is laid down as a confirmation; for in this case our contest is altogether with perverseness, if we try to retaliate it, we confess that we are overcome by it; if, on the contrary, we return good for evil, by that very deed we show the invincible firmness of our mind. This is truly a most glorious kind of victory, the fruit of which is not only apprehended by the mind, but really perceived, while the Lord is giving success to their patience, than which they can wish nothing better. On the other hand, he who attempts to overcome evil with evil, may perhaps surpass his enemy in doing injury, but it is to his own ruin; for by acting thus he carries on war for the devil. </p></div>
