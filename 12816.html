<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">王从御园回到酒席之处，见哈曼伏在以斯帖所靠的榻上。王说，他竟敢在宫内，在我面前凌辱王后吗？这话一出王口，人就蒙了哈曼的脸。</div></div>
