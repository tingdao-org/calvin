<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>Called of God, </em>or <em>named by God, etc. </em>As it was necessary that he should pursue more at large the comparison between Christ and Melchisedec, on which he had briefly touched, and that the mind of the Jews should be stirred up to greater attention, he so passes to a digression that he still retails his argument. </p></div>
