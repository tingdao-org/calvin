<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那脱离刀剑的人必在所掳到的各国中记念我，为他们心中何等伤破，是因他们起淫心，远离我，眼对偶像行邪淫。他们因行一切可憎的恶事，必厌恶自己。</div></div>
