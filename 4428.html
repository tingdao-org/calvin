<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>11.</strong><em>And Balak said unto Balaam. </em>The proud man again reproaches the false prophet, as if he had fairly purchased of him the right of prophecy. <span class="cite-ref">(159)</span> Behold how the reprobate seek God by crooked paths, and desire to have nothing to do with Him, unless He yields to their improper wishes — in a word, unless they render Him submissive to them. Balaam, therefore, is compelled to repress this stupid arrogance, by pleading God’s command, and declaring that nothing more was allowed him than to announce what God prescribed. But we must remember that this was only spoken in reference to a particular act, when, as far as his words went, he acted the part of a true prophet, although his feelings were altogether on the other side. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(159)</span> L’authorite de le faire parler comme il veudroit;” the authority to make him speak whatever he chose. —<em>Fr </em></p></div></div>
