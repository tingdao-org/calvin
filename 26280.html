<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">第二日，站在海那边的众人，知道那里没有别的船，只有一只小船，又知道耶稣没有同他的门徒上船，乃是门徒自己去的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>Next day. </em>Here the Evangelist relates circumstances from which the multitude might conclude that Christ had gone across by divine power. There had been but one ship; they see it go away without Christ; next day, ships come from other places, by which they are conveyed to Capernaum; and there they find Christ. It follows that he must have been conveyed across in a miraculous manner. There is an intricacy and apparent confusion (<span class="lang el-gr">ἀνακόλουθον</span>) in the words, but still the meaning of them is plain enough; for, in the 22<span class="cite-ref">nd</span> verse, John says that <em>there had been but one ship</em>, and that all saw it leave the shore and that place, and that it had not Christ as a passenger; and, in the 23<span class="cite-ref">rd</span> verse, he adds that <em>ships came from Tiberias, </em>by which the multitude passed over, which had remained on the shore, blockading, as it were, every outlet, that Christ might not escape. </p></div>
