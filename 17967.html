<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为宁林的水成为干涸。青草枯干，嫩草灭没，青绿之物，一无所有。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>The waters of Nimrim. </em>By an exaggerated form of expression he gives a more enlarged view of this desolation. He says that <em>the grass is withered</em>, which takes place when God leaves any soil destitute of all nourishment. <em>The waters </em>will be taken away, which probably were highly necessary for that dry and parched country; for soils of that kind produce nothing without irrigation. Though the style is exaggerated, yet nothing is stated but what is strictly true; for the Prophet did not go beyond proper bounds, but found it necessary to use bold expressions to suit the ignorance of the people, in order to inform them that a land which is deprived of the blessing of God will be like a desert without any beauty. </p></div>
