<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们便进到王前，提王的禁令，说，王阿，三十日内不拘何人，若在王以外，或向神或向人求什么，必被扔在狮子坑中。王不是在这禁令上盖了玉玺吗？王回答说，实有这事，照玛代和波斯人的例，是不可更改的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now the king’s nobles approach the king as conquerors, but they do so cunningly; for they do not openly say anything about Daniel, whom they knew to be a favorite with the king; but they repeat their previous assertion concerning the impossibility of changing the edict, since the law of the Medes and Persians is inviolable and cannot be rendered void. Again, therefore, as far as they possibly can, they sanction that edict, lest the king should afterwards be free, or dare to retract what he had once commanded. We must mark the cunning with which they indirectly circumvent the king, and entangle him, by preventing the change of a single word; <em>They come, </em>therefore,<em>and discourse concerning the royal edict. </em>They do not mention the name of Daniel, but dwell upon the royal decree, so as to bind the king more firmly. It follows — <em>The king answered, The discourse is true </em>We here see how kings desire praise for consistency, but they do not perceive the difference between consistency and obstinacy. For kings ought to reflect upon their own decrees, to avoid the disgrace of retracting what they have hastily promulgated. If anything has escaped them without consideration, both prudence and equity require them to correct their errors; but when they have trampled upon all regard for justice, they desire every inconsiderate command to be strictly obeyed! This is the height of folly, and we ought not to sanction a perseverance in such obstinacy, as we have already said. But the rest to-morrow. </p></div>
