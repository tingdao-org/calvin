<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们又把尘土撒在头上，哭泣悲哀，喊着说，哀哉，哀哉，这大城阿。凡有船在海中的，都因她的珍宝成了富足。她在一时之间就成了荒场。</div></div>
