<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">众人希奇说，这是怎样的人，连风和海也听从他了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>27.</strong><em>But the men wondered </em>Mark and Luke appear to say this in reference to the apostles; for, after having stated that Christ reproved them, they add that they cried out with fear, <em>Who is this? </em>It applies, however, more properly to others, who had not yet known Christ. Whether we take the one or the other of these views, the result of the miracle appears in the display of the glory of Christ. If any one shall suppose that it is the apostles who speak, the meaning of the words will be, that his divine power was sufficiently proved by the fact that <em>the wind and the sea obey him </em>But as it is more probable that these words were spoken by others, the Evangelists show that the miracle made such an impression on their minds, as to produce a certain reverence for Christ which prepared them for believing on him. </p></div>
