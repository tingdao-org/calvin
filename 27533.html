<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">弟兄们，随即在夜间打发保罗和西拉往庇哩亚去。二人到了，就进入犹太人的会堂。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>10.</strong><em>They sent them out to Berea. </em>Hereby it appeareth that Paul’s labor brought forth fruit in a small time; for though the brethren send forth him and Silas, yet they adjoin themselves as voluntary companions to their danger and cross by this duty. But the constancy of Paul is incredible, because, having had such experience of their stubbornness and malice of his nation, he doth never cease to try whether he can bring any to Christ, namely, seeing he knew that he was bound both to Jews and Gentiles, no injury of men could lead him away from his calling. So all the servants of Christ must so wrestle with the malice of the world, that they shake not off Christ’s yoke with what injuries soever they be provoked. </p></div>
