<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶和华论列国的话临到先知耶利米。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremiah begins here to prophesy against foreign nations, and continues to do so to the last chapter but one, not that he then for the first time began to announce these oracles, but as I have already said, a volume was at length formed, including his prophecies, the order of time being not everywhere observed; for we see in the 25<span class="cite-ref">th</span> chapter that he threatened heathen nations with the punishments they had deserved before Jehoiakim was made king. But as I have said, the prophecies respecting heathen nations have been separated, though as to time Jeremiah had predicted what afterwards happened. </p></div>
