<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你们受苦如此之多，都是徒然的吗？难道果真是徒然的吗？</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>Have ye suffered so many things? </em>This is another argument. Having suffered so many things in behalf of the gospel, would they now, in an instant, lose it all? Nay, he puts it in the way of reproach, if they were willing to lose the advantage of so many illustrious struggles which they had made for the faith. If the true faith had not been delivered to them by Paul, it was rash to suffer anything in defense of a bad cause; but they had experienced the presence of God amidst their persecutions. Accordingly, he charges the false apostles with ill-will in depriving the Galatians of such valuable ornaments. But to mitigate the severity of this complaint, he adds, <em>if it be yet in vain</em>; thus inspiring their minds with the expectation of something better, and rousing them to the exercise of repentance. For the intention of all chastisement is, not to drive men to despair, but to lead them to a better course. </p></div>
