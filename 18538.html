<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们要发生在草中，像溪水旁的柳树。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>4.</strong><em>And they shall spring up. </em>These words contain nothing more than what I quoted from <span class="bvs">Psa_104:30</span>, that, when the Spirit of God has been sent forth, the whole face of the earth is renewed, and those fields which formerly were burnt up with thirst are green and flourish, just as the herbs grow, after having been watered by the rains. By these metaphors he extends the view of this subject, and more fully shews that it is quite as easy for God to enlarge by additional offspring the Church, which was desolate, and which had been reduced to ruinous and frightful solitude, as to impart to the earth the power of bringing forth. Yet, though he does not speak of regeneration, still we may apply to it this statement; because he speaks of the restoration of the Church, the chief part of which is the new creature by which the Lord restores his image in the elect. This doctrine may indeed be drawn from it and more copiously explained, but we must first explain the Prophet’s design, and lay open the plain and natural meaning of his words. </p></div>
