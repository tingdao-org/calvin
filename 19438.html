<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">给我父亲报信说你得了儿子，使我父亲甚欢喜的，愿那人受咒诅。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>We said yesterday that the Prophet’s confused state of mind is described in this passage; for he would have no doubt himself confessed, that he was carried away by an intemperate feeling, so as not to be himself; for it is to cast reproach on God when any one curses his own birth-day. And he goes farther than this, for he adds, <em>Cursed be the man who declared to my father, that a male child was born </em>Here he not only fights against God, but is also ungrateful towards men; for what but thanks did he deserve who first told his father that he had a son born to him? It was then an ingratitude in no way excusable And hence we also learn that the Prophet had no control over his feelings, but was wholly led away by a blind impulse, which made him to utter very inconsiderate words; for in this sentence there is no piety nor humanity; but as I have said, the Prophet was ungrateful to men as well as to God; and his hyperbolical language also more fully expresses how intemperate his feelings were, <em>who declared to my father that a male child was born </em>He seems here, as though he avowedly despised God’s favor, for we know that males are preferred to females. But the Prophet mentions here the word male, as though he wished to complain of what he ought to have been thankful for. </p></div>
