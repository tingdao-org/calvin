<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为这蝗虫遮满地面，甚至地都黑暗了，又吃地上一切的菜蔬和冰雹所剩树上的果子。埃及遍地，无论是树木，是田间的菜蔬，连一点青的也没有留下。</div></div>
