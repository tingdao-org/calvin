<div class="comment-content"><p>He goes on with the same subject, — that the Jews were not moved by any fear when they saw the dreadful vengeance executed on their brethren on account of their sins. <em>Her perfidious sister, </em>he says, <em>returned not to me, </em>that is, after so many warnings by the prophets and such an example of punishment. He however adds an explanation, — she <em>turned not with her whole heart, but feignedly </em>and falsely. <span class="cite-ref">(80)</span></p><p>The Prophet anticipates here such objections as the Jews might have alleged, “What! thou deniest that we have returned! Is not the whole land cleansed from idolatries? Is not God worshipped according to the requirements of the law? Is there any more an altar seen under the shades of trees or on hills?” As then they might have thus evaded the charge as they usually did, the Prophet obviates such an evasion and says, “Though they have ill appearance given some tokens of repentance, yet they have only put on a disguise and have acted falsely towards God; for there is no integrity in them.” We now more clearly see why he had before specifically mentioned the time of Josiah; for the Jews then returned feignedly to God: there was in the king and in a few a right feeling, but in the rest dissimulation only. God then in a few words shews, that he cares not for that reformation which is false and feigned, but that he requires a genuine feeling within: hence he thus concludes — </p><p><strong>(80)</strong> This verse stands connected, not with the preceding, but with the eighth, — </p><p>Yea, even for all this, Return to me did not the hypocrite, Her sister Judah, with all her heart, But in falsehood, saith Jehovah. </p><p>“In falsehood,” or, by dealing falsely, as it may be taken by a participle preceded by a preposition. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div>
