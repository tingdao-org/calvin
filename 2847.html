<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>16.</strong><em>And he shall make amends for the harm. </em>Hence it more plainly appears, as I have recently stated, that they, who withheld anything of God’s full right, are said to have sinned “in the holy thing;” since they are commanded to make restitution with the addition of a fifth part. Yet let my readers remember, that those who are compelled to make restitution, are not such as have fraudulently embezzled the sacred things, but those who under some vain pretext have flattered themselves for a time, so as to be unaffected by any conviction of their fault. The object therefore of this sacrifice, was to arouse the people to attention, so that postponing their private advantage, they should freely pay what was due to God. <span class="cite-ref">(270)</span> Theirs is but foolish trifling who think that Moses, having before spoken of sins (<em>peccata </em>), now prescribes the mode of making expiation for delinquencies (<em>delicta </em>), since he uses the same words indifferently on all occasions, and also designates all the victims by the same name. But to make out a delinquency to be greater than a sin is a piece of gross ignorance; nor does it need a long refutation, since it manifestly appears that in this passage a special rule is delivered as to the means of obtaining pardon when a person through thoughtlessness has not reflected that he has omitted to discharge in full either his vows or oblations. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(270)</span> This is the gloss of Bonfrerius in Poole’s Synopsis. </p></div></div>
