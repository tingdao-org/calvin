<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">当日，大卫说，谁攻打耶布斯人，当上水沟攻打我心里所恨恶的瘸子，瞎子。从此有俗语说，在那里有瞎子，瘸子，他不能进屋去。</div></div>
