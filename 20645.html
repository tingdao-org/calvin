<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，并不掉转。头向何方，他们也随向何方，行走的时候并不掉转。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>Now, as I have remarked, after the Prophet has granted that there are certain events of things as it were twisted and bending, and that God acts through windings, he then shows that God does nothing rashly: and that the events which we think tumultuous and confused have a certain direction, and that too the best. For this reason he says, first that the <em>wheels had set out, they did not return, since each followed its own head </em>Interpreters do not agree on these words. For as to the turning of the head, some translate it <em>“ </em>the first,” and thus mean that in whatever way the first cherub goes, the others follow him. But I rather think that the wheels are compared with the cherubs themselves, and the singular noun head is here put for heads: for we before saw that wheels were annexed to each cherub, Therefore each wheel has its own head, that is, has a living creature by which it is ruled. Hence the sense of the Prophet is, that the ‘wheels turned on this side or on that, by any outward or sudden impulse, but were governed by the cherubim themselves, which will explain this portion more clearly. </p></div>
