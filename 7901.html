<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">大卫听见拿八死了，就说，应当称颂耶和华，因他伸了拿八羞辱我的冤，又阻止仆人行恶。也使拿八的恶归到拿八的头上。于是大卫打发人去，与亚比该说，要娶她为妻。</div></div>
