<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>And take the helmet of salvation. </em>In a passage already quoted, (<span class="bvs">1Th_5:8</span>,) “the <em>hope </em>of salvation” is said to be a <em>helmet, </em>which I consider to be in the same sense as this passage. The head is protected by the best <em>helmet, </em>when, elevated by <em>hope, </em>we look up towards heaven to that <em>salvation </em>which is promised. It is only therefore by becoming the object of <em>hope </em>that <em>salvation </em>is a <em>helmet. </em></p></div>
