<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">你下到阴间，阴间就因你震动，来迎接你。又因你惊动在世曾为首领的阴魂，并使那曾为列国君王的，都离位站起。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>9.</strong><em>Hell from beneath is moved for thee. </em><span class="cite-ref">(217)</span> As he had formerly attributed gladness to the trees, so now, by a similar figure, he attributes speech to <em>the dead </em><span class="cite-ref">(218)</span> He arouses them, as it were, from their <em>graves</em>, to mock at the pride of this tyrant. The whole passage is ironical, and full of keen sarcasm. At the approach of kings, the people tremble, and come forth to meet and receive them with pompous display. The Prophet makes a fictitious representation, that when this tyrant shall die and go down to <em>the grave, the dead </em>will go forth to meet and honor him, but with such honor as he deserves. As if he had said, “Not only the living, but also <em>the dead </em>will rejoice at his death. <em>The dead </em>also will treat him respectfully according to his deserts.” </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(217)</span> Bogus footnote </p><p><span class="cite-note">(218)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
