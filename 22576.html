<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">次日黎明，神却安排一条虫子咬这蓖麻，以致枯槁。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>But it is said afterwards that <em>a worm was prepared</em>. We see here also, that what seemed to happen by chance was yet directed by the hidden providence of God. Should any one say, that what is here narrated does not commonly happen, but what once happened; to this I answer, — that though God then designed to exhibit a wonderful example, worthy of being remembered, it is yet ever true that the gnawing even of worms are directed by the counsel of God, so that neither a herb nor a tree withers independently of his purpose. The same truth is declared by Christ when he says, that without the Father’s appointment the sparrows fall not on the ground, (<span class="bvs">Mat_10:29</span>.) Thus much as to the worm. </p></div>
