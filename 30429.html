<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"</div>
<div class="CUV verse">因为古时仰赖神的圣洁妇人，正是以此为妆饰，顺服自己的丈夫。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He sets before them the example of pious women, who sought for spiritual adorning rather than outward meretricious ornaments. But he mentions Sarah above all others, who, having been the mother of all the faithful, is especially worthy of honor and imitation on the part of her sex. Moreover, he returns again to subjection, and confirms it by the example of Sarah, who, according to the words of Moses, called her husband Lord. (<span class="bvs">Gen_18:12</span>.) God, indeed, does not regard such titles; and it may sometimes be, that one especially petulant and disobedient should use such a word with her tongue; but Peter means, that Sarah usually spoke thus, because she knew that a command had been given her by the Lord, to be subject to her husband. Peter adds, that they who imitated her fidelity would be her daughters, that is, reckoned among the faithful. </p></div>
