<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那忍受罪人这样顶撞的，你们要思想，免得疲倦灰心。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>3.</strong><em>For consider him, etc. </em>He enforces his exhortation by comparing Christ with us; for if the Son of God, whom it behaves all to adore, willingly underwent such severe conflicts, who of us should dare to refuse to submit with him to the same? For this one thought alone ought to be sufficient to conquer all temptations, that is, when we know that we are companions or associates of the Son of God, and that he, who was so far above us, willingly came down to our condition, in order that he might animate us by his own example; yea, it is thus that we gather courage, which would otherwise melt away, and turn as it were into despair. </p></div>
