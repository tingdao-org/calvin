<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">天将晚的时候，门徒进前来说，这是野地，时候已经过了。请叫众人散开，他们好往村子里去，自己买吃的。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>When the evening was drawing on. </em>The disciples had now lost their object, and they see that Christ is again absorbed in teaching, while the multitudes are so eager to receive instruction that they do not think of retiring. Theytherefore advise that for the sake of attending to their bodily wants, Christ should <em>send them away into the neighboring villages. </em>He had purposely delayed till now the miracle which he intended to perform; first, that his disciples might consider it more attentively, and might thus derive from it greater advantage; and next, that the very circumstance of the time might convince them that, though he does not prevent, and even does not immediately supply, the wants of his people, yet he never ceases to care for them, but has always at hand the assistance which he affords at the very time when it is required. </p></div>
