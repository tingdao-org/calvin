<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">耶路撒冷被攻取的时候，巴比伦王的首领尼甲沙利薛，三甲尼波，撒西金，拉撒力，尼甲沙利薛，拉墨，并巴比伦王其余的一切首领都来坐在中门。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>IT is proved here that the prophecy of Jeremiah was fulfilled; so that it became really evident that he had not spoken unadvisedly, but from the mouth of God. And thus was fulfilled also what is said as a common proverb, that fools become wise too late; for they never obey good and wise counsels while they may, but at length they are made to know by their own miseries and their teacher, experience, that what they despised is true, but without any benefit. This happened to Zedekiah, who had been often exhorted by the Prophet to surrender himself to King Nebuchadnezzar. As, then, he had obstinately refused the yoke, he was at length constrained to reap the fruit of his obstinacy. </p><p>Now Jeremiah says, that <em>the princes </em>of King Nebuchadnezzar, that is, those he had set over his forces, <em>entered the city, </em>the wall being broken down, and <em>sat in the middle gate; </em>for it was necessary for them to be wary, lest there should be ambushes; and even conquerors do not immediately penetrate into every part when a city is taken, but search whether all the places be free from enemies. This then was done by the leaders of the army, for they stood in <em>the middle gate, </em>that they might exercise authority over the city, and yet be safe from all ambushes. Jeremiah mentions some of them by name, but it is uncertain whether he adds a surname to some of them. But as this is doubtful and is of no great moment, it is enough for us that the chief of the leaders are named, in order to accredit the narrative. </p></div>
