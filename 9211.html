<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">那带神人回来的先知听见这事，就说，这是那违背了耶和华命令的神人，所以耶和华把他交给狮子。狮子抓伤他，咬死他，是应验耶和华对他说的话。</div></div>
