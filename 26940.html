<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他本来列在我们数中，并且在使徒的职任上得了一分。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>17.</strong><em>Adopted. </em>It is word for word <em>reckoned. </em>And he saith that he was one of the number, that he might signify unto them that it was needful that the empty place should be filled, to the end that the number might continue whole. And to this propose serveth that which followeth, that he had obtained a part in the ministry. For thereupon it doth follow that the body should be, as it were, lame, if that part should be wanting. Surely it was a thing which might make them greatly amazed, that he whom Christ had extolled unto so high dignity should fall headlong into such destruction. Which circumstance doth increase the cruelty of the fact, <span class="cite-ref">(60)</span> and teacheth the rest to take heed unto themselves. <span class="cite-ref">(61)</span> Neither is it to be doubted but that the disciples did remember Judas with great grief and sorrow. But Peter doth here express by name the excellency of his function, that he might make them more attentive and more careful to provide a remedy. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(60)</span> “Atrocitatem sceleris,” the atrocity of the crime. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(61)</span> “Ut sibi caveant et metuani,” to be cautious and fear. </p></div></div>
