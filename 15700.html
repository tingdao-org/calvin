<div class="CUV verse">耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的，从亘古直到永远。愿众民都说，阿们。你们要赞美耶和华。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>48.</strong><em>Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel </em>The prophet here regulates the prayers and desires of the people in such a way, as that, amid their grievous oppression, the dejected captives may not cease to render thanks to God; and this is a matter which must be carefully attended to, because, when borne down by adversity, there is scarcely one among a hundred, who, with composure of spirit, draws near to God; but, on the contrary, he betrays the pride of his heart by the careless and insipid manner in which he prays, or in pouring out complaints about his afflicted condition. But the only way in which we can expect God to lend a favorable ear to the voice of our supplications is, in the spirit of meekness to submit to his corrections, and patiently to bear the cross which he is pleased to lay upon us. It is with great propriety then, that the prophet exhorts the afflicted captives to bless God, even when he was chastising them with considerable severity. It is to the same purpose that it is added, <em>let the people say, Amen; </em>as if he were commanding them all to consent to the praises of God, though both privately and publicly they were overwhelmed in a sea of troubles. </p></div>
