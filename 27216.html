<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利，他走遍那地方，在各城宣传福音，直到该撒利亚。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>40.</strong><em>He was found at Azotus. </em>It is well known, out of the book of <span class="bvs">Jos_11:22</span>, that Azotus was one of the cities out of which the sons of Anak could not be expelled. It is distant from Ascalon almost two hundred furlongs; the Hebrews call it Ashdod. Thither was Philip carried; there began he to take his journey on foot after the manner of men, sowing the seed of the gospel wheresoever he became, [passed.] This is surely rare and wonderful stoutness, <span class="cite-ref">(568)</span> that he spreadeth the name of godliness in his journey. And whereas Luke saith expressly that he preached in all cities until he came to Cesarea, and doth not declare that he returned to Samaria, we may thereby conjecture that he staid at Cesarea for a time; and yet I leave this indifferent. </p><p><strong>(568)</strong> “Strenuitas,” strenuousness, activity. </p></div>
