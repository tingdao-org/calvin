<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他必降临，像雨降在已割的草地上，如甘霖滋润田地。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>6.</strong><em>He shall descend as the rain upon the mown grass. </em>This comparison may seem at first sight to be somewhat harsh; but it elegantly and appositely expresses the great advantage which is derived by all from the good and equitable constitution of a kingdom. Meadows, we know, are cut in the beginning of summer when the heat prevails; and did not the earth imbibe new moisture by the falling rain, even the very roots of the herbage would wither by reason of the barren and parched state of the soil. David, therefore, teaches us that as God defends the earth from the heat of the sun by watering it, so he in like manner provides for the welfare of his Church, and defends it under the government of the king. But this prediction has received its highest fulfillment in Christ, who, by distilling upon the Church his secret grace, renders her fruitful. </p></div>
