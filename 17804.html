<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>21.</strong><em>And it shall come to pass on that day. </em>In these verses, down to the end of the chapter, the Prophet describes the state of a country torn and wasted; for he intends to present a striking and lively picture of such overwhelming distress that, wherever you turn your eyes, nothing is to be seen but the traces of frightful desolation. Some think that a mitigation of punishment is here promised, but we shall soon see that this does not agree with the context. Though he employs the appellation, <em>a man</em>, without any limitation, yet strictly it is of the richest men that he speaks; for he does not say that every one will have so many; but they who formerly were accustomed to rear a large number of <em>oxen </em>and <em>sheep </em>will be satisfied with having a few. He means, therefore, that all will be reduced to very deep poverty. Some think that the Hebrew word which the Prophet employs, <span class="lang he-il">יחיה</span>, (<em>yechaiyeh</em>,) <em>he shall quicken</em>, means “to deliver from death;” but the meaning which I have adopted is more natural and more generally approved. </p></div>
