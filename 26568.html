<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>45.</strong><em>Many therefore of the Jews believed on him. </em>Christ did not permit the miracle which he had wrought to be without fruit, for by means of it he drew some persons to the faith. For we ought to understand that miracles have a twofold use. They are intended either to prepare us for faith, or to confirm us in faith. The former is here denoted by the Evangelist; for he means that those of whom he speaks regarded Christ with admiration and reverence, so as to submit to be his disciples; otherwise the bare miracle could not have been sufficient to produce faith. Accordingly, by the word <em>believe </em>we must not suppose anything else to be meant than a willingness to embrace the doctrine of Christ. </p></div>
