<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">农夫阿，你们要惭愧，修理葡萄园的阿，你们要哀号，因为大麦小麦，与田间的庄稼，都灭绝了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet says nothing new here, but only strengthens what he had said before, and is not wordy without reason; for he intends here not merely to teach, but also to produce an effect: And this is the design of heavenly teaching; for God not only wishes that what he says may be understood, but intends also to penetrate into our hearts: and the word of God, we know, consists not of doctrine only, but also of exhortations, and threatenings, and reproofs. This plan then the Prophet now pursues: <em>Ye husband men, </em>he says, <em>be ashamed, and ye vinedressers, howl; for perished has the harvest of the field. </em>The sum of the whole is, that the Jews, as we have already said, could by no excuse cover their indifference; for their clamor was everywhere heard, their complaints everywhere resounded, that the land had become a waste, that they were themselves famished that they were afflicted with many calamities; and yet no one acknowledged that God, who visited them for their sins, was the author. But what remains I shall put off until to-morrow. </p></div>
