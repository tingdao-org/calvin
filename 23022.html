<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">他们必如勇士，在阵上将仇敌践踏在街上的泥土中。他们必争战，因为耶和华与他们同在。骑马的也必羞愧。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>He confirms what I have already said — that the Jews would be victorious over all nations. Though the Church is fighting under the cross, she yet triumphs over all the wicked, partly by hope and partly by present success; for God wonderfully sustains it, and makes the faithful to possess their souls in patience; and he also protects them by his own power, and renders them safe amidst all the roarings and insatiable rage of their enemies. Since then God thus strengthens the minds of his people, and cherishes in them the hope of salvation, and also defends them against raging assaults, it is no wonder that the Prophet testifies that the church would be victorious, treading down, as a giant or a strong man, her enemies in the mire. </p><p>He gives the reason, <em>For Jehovah will be with them</em>; and this he said, that they might know that nothing in this case would be their own, but that they might, on the contrary, learn to depend on God’s aid alone. And he explains this still more clearly at the end of the verse, by saying, <em>Ashamed shall be the riders on horses</em>; <span class="cite-ref">(119)</span> that is, their strength and velour, their use of arms and their skill in handling them, shall avail them nothing, for the Lord will lay prostrate, notwithstanding their arrogance and pride, all those wicked men who in their cruelty devour the faithful, and think that they have strength more than enough to destroy the Church: the Lord will cause all these things to pass away like mist. </p><p><strong>(119)</strong><em>Henderson </em>says, that this refers to the numerous cavalry of the SyroGrecian army. See <span class="bvs">1Ma_3:39</span>. — <em>Ed. </em></p></div>
