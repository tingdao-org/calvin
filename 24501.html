<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>37.</strong><em>He hath done all things well. </em>Matthew, after collecting many miracles, concludes by saying that <em>the multitudes wondered, and glorified the God of Israel; </em>that is, because God, taking unusual methods of illustrating his power, had called up the remembrance of his covenant. But the words of Mark contain perhaps an implied contrast; for the reports concerning Christ were various, and the word <em>multitude </em>or <em>crowd </em>( <span class="lang el-gr">ὄχλος</span>) may be intended to mean that it was only wicked and malicious persons who slandered his actions, since all that he did was so far from exposing him to calumny that it deserved the highest praise. But we know, and it is what nature teaches us, that nothing is more unjust than to make the bestowal of favors an occasion of envy and ill-will. </p></div>
