<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">但人从琐拉和以实陶打发本族中的五个勇士，去仔细窥探那地，吩咐他们说，你们去窥探那地。他们来到以法莲山地，进了米迦的住宅，就在那里住宿。</div></div>
