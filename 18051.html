<div class="CUV verse">因为他们逃避刀剑，和出了鞘的刀，并上了弦的弓，与刀兵的重灾。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>15.</strong><em>For they flee from the face of the swords. </em><span class="cite-ref">(74)</span> He means that the calamity will be dreadful, and that the Arabians will have good reason for betaking themselves to flight, because the enemies will pursue them with arms and with swords, so that they will have no other way of providing for their safety than by flight. The reason why he foretells this defeat is plain enough; for it was necessary that the Jews should obtain early information of that which should happen long after, that they might learn that the world is governed by the providence of God and not by chance, and likewise that they should be taught by the example of others to behold God as the judge of all nations, wherever they turned their eyes. We do not know, and history does not inform us, whether or not the Arabians were enemies of the Jews. However that may be, it is certain that these things are spoken for the consolation of the godly, that they may behold the justice of God towards all nations, and may acknowledge that his judgment-seat is at Jerusalem, from which he will pronounce judgment on the whole world. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(74)</span> Bogus footnote </p></div></div>
