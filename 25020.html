<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions."</div>
<div class="CUV verse">过了三天，就遇见他在殿里，坐在教师中间，一面听，一面问。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>46.</strong><em>Sitting in the midst of the doctors </em>Rays of divine brightness must have evidently shone in this child: otherwise those haughty men would not have permitted him to sit along with them. Though it is probable that he occupied a lower seat, and not the rank of the doctors, yet such disdainful men would not have condescended to give him an audience in a public assembly, if some divine power had not constrained them. This was a sort of prelude to his public calling, the full time of which had not yet arrived. In this way, however, he intended to give nothing more than a taste, which would immediately have faded from the recollection of men, had not Mary <em>kept </em>it for us <em>laid up in her heart, </em>(<span class="bvs">Luk_2:19</span>,) to bring it out afterwards, along with other treasures, for the use of all the godly. </p></div>
