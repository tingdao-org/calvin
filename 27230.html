<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">并且他在这里有从祭司长得来的权柄捆绑一切求告你名的人。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>14.</strong><em>He hath power to bind. </em>We gather by these words, that the fame of the persecution which Saul went about <span class="cite-ref">(590)</span> was spread far and wide; for which cause his conversion was <span class="cite-ref">(591)</span> more famous. Nevertheless, the Lord suffered the faithful to be evil entreated, <span class="cite-ref">(592)</span> that the benefit of such sudden deliverance might afterwards be the more excellent. We must mark that speech, when he saith that the godly call upon the name of Christ. For whether you understand it, that inasmuch as they professed that they were Christ’s, they rejoiced therefore in him, or that they used to fly to him for succor, invocation cannot be without sure confidence. By both which the divinity of Christ is not only proved, but also if the second be received, which seemeth to be more natural, <span class="cite-ref">(593)</span> we are taught by the example of the faithful, to call upon the name of Christ when he is preached to us. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(590)</span> “Parabat,” was preparing. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(591)</span> “Debuit,” must have been. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(592)</span> “Misere cruciari,” miserably tortured. </p><p><span class="cite-note">(593)</span> “Genuinum,” genuine. </p></div></div>
