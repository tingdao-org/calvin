<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</div>
<div class="CUV verse">按着律法，凡物差不多都是用血洁净的，若不流血，罪就不得赦免了。</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>22.</strong><em>And almost all things, etc. </em>By saying <em>almost </em>he seems to imply that some things were otherwise purified. And doubtless they often washed themselves and other unclean things with water. But even water itself derived its power to cleanse from the sacrifices; so that the Apostle at length truly declares that without blood there was no remission. <span class="cite-ref">(156)</span> Then uncleanness was imputed until it was expiated by a sacrifice. And as without Christ there is no purity nor salvation, so nothing without blood can be either pure or saving; for Christ is never to be separated from the sacrifice of his death. But the Apostle meant only to say that this symbol was almost always made use of. But if at any time the purgation was not so made, it was nevertheless through blood, since all the rites derived their efficacy in a manner from the general expiation. For the people were not each of them sprinkled, (for how could so small a portion of blood be sufficient for so large a multitude?) yet the purgation extended to all. Hence the particle <em>almost </em>signifies the same as though he had said, that the use of this rite was so common that they seldom omitted it in purgations. For what Chrysostom says, that unfitness is thus denoted, because these were only figures under the Law, is inconsistent with the Apostle’s design. </p><p><em>No remission, etc. </em>Thus men are prevented from appearing before God; for as he is justly displeased with them all, there is no ground for them to promise themselves any favor until he is pacified. But there is but one way of pacification, and that is by an expiation made by blood: hence no pardon of sins can be hoped for unless we bring blood, and this is done when we flee by faith to the death of Christ. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(156)</span> Metals were purified by fire, and clothes by being washed in water, (<span class="bvs">Num_31:22</span>;) but these were purifications not accompanied with remission of sins. So that what is said here is literally true. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
