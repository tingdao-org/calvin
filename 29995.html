<div class="comment-content"><p><strong>18.</strong><em>For in that he himself has suffered, etc. </em>Having been tried by our evils, he is ready, he says, to bring us help. The word <em>temptation </em>here means no other thing than experience or probation; and to be <em>able, </em>is to be fit, or inclined, or suitable. </p></div>
