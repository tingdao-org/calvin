<div class="verses"><div class="KJV verse">A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;</div>
<div class="CUV verse">国中有可惊骇，可憎恶的事，</div></div>
<div class="comment-content"><p>The Prophet, being not satisfied with the reproof which we have observed, speaks still more strongly against the wickedness of the people. He then says, that so deplorable was their state as to make all to feel amazed. <em>A stupendous thing, </em>he says, has happened, which exceeds all human conception, and cannot be comprehended. By the two words he uses, he intimates that the impiety of the people could not be expressed in words or could not be conceived by the mind; for it was a monstrous thing. This is the meaning. <span class="cite-ref">(157)</span></p><div class="notes"><p><span class="cite-note">(157)</span> The words literally are, — </p><p>Amazement and horribleness has been done in the land. </p><p>That is, what occasioned both had been done, or what ought to have filled all with the feeling of amazement and horror. — <em>Ed</em>. </p></div></div>
